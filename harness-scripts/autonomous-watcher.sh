#!/usr/bin/env bash
# autonomous-watcher.sh — the outer loop: a long-running local daemon that turns a
# file dropped in the inbox into an unattended engine run, tracks every run it
# started, and tells an operator when one ends.
#
# IT IS A THIN ADAPTER OVER THE ENGINE COMMANDS, AND NOTHING MORE. Each inbox
# filename pattern is bound to one (engine command, worktree strategy) pairing:
#
#   <branch>_task_prompt.md   -> /branch-start-plan-autonomous
#                                a fresh sibling working copy off the default
#                                branch (create-worktree.sh)
#   <branch>_review[_<n>].md  -> /branch-start-user-review-fix-autonomous
#                                the branch's existing working copy when it is
#                                still usable, else recreated for that branch
#   <branch>_docs.md          -> /branch-start-docs-autonomous
#                                a fresh working copy, as the task path; the
#                                dropped file IS the curated checklist
#
# The watcher knows only about inbox files, working copies, central logs, the run
# registry (including which engine each run was launched with), the concurrency
# cap, the kill switch, and exit notifications — and, when `execution.target` is
# `github-actions`, it also dispatches a drop to GitHub Actions instead of
# spawning it (see REMOTE DISPATCH). IT CONTAINS NO PLANNING,
# IMPLEMENTATION OR FIX ORCHESTRATION LOGIC — all of that lives in the engine
# commands, which resolve their own anchors inside the working copy they run in.
# That is what keeps a future trigger (an issue label, a webhook) a drop-in
# adapter feeding the SAME engines rather than a second copy of the flow.
#
# WHAT THIS COPY IMPLEMENTS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT YET DO. The
# watcher is landing in slices. This one carries the anchors, the tunables, the
# registry, the kill switch, the vanished-process reconcile pass, `status`, the
# tick/watch loop the later passes hang off, the LAUNCH HALF — `spawn_engine`
# (one detached subshell running one headless engine session), `launch_run` (the
# bookkeeping around it, plus the live-log window) and `classify_run_exit` (the
# terminal-state decision that subshell ends with) — and THE INBOX PASS that
# feeds them: routing a dropped filename to its (engine, working-copy strategy)
# pairing, preparing that working copy, placing and committing the dropped
# artifact, archiving the inbox file, and launching the run. THE INBOX IS
# THEREFORE CONSUMED BY THIS COPY, which the slice before it deliberately did not
# do. It also carries THE TWO RESUME PASSES, the only ones that bring a run BACK:
# a `parked` run whose clarification answer has landed, and a `paused` run whose
# RESUME sentinel has landed. Both re-launch the SAME engine in the run's
# EXISTING working copy — they never create one — through `spawn_engine`'s 4th
# and 5th arguments, and they are what makes yielding a session cost nothing
# while a run waits. For a record whose `execution` is `github-actions` each
# pass instead DISPATCHES (`remote-run.sh dispatch … --resume answer|pause`)
# rather than re-launching through `spawn_engine`, and it neither consults the
# lane nor holds a cap slot — see REMOTE DISPATCH. ONE OTHER PATH brings a run back, and only inside a job
# (HARNESS_JOB_MODE=1): job mode's BOUNDED AUTO-RESUME, which relaunches a
# `failed` or overload-`paused` run through the same `spawn_engine` 5th
# argument at most REMOTE_AUTO_RESUME_MAX times per run — see JOB MODE. The park resume is bounded by THE PARK-LOOP GUARD: a run
# whose park-resumes keep parking without progress becomes `park_loop` and is
# resumed no further until an operator creates PARK_LOOP_CLEAR in its
# clarification directory. And it carries the last two passes: THE STALENESS WATCHDOG,
# described next, and THE USAGE GATE after it — which is what finally WRITES the
# hold marker every earlier pass already reads — plus THE MACHINE-LEVEL LANE that
# gate publishes into and every start consults, described below them.
# `classify_run_exit` is only ever called from inside the subshell `spawn_engine`
# spawns, which is the one place the engine's real exit code exists.
#
# THE STALENESS WATCHDOG HEALS WHAT THE RECONCILE PASS CANNOT SEE. That pass
# heals a run whose PROCESS IS ALREADY GONE. A run whose process is alive but
# whose session has stopped producing output is invisible to it: the record stays
# `running` for as long as the watcher does, holding a slot under the concurrency
# cap that nothing will ever free. The watchdog reads liveness from the newest
# mtime across the run's central log AND its raw `<log>.stream.jsonl` — the raw
# stream is appended on every event, so it is the more sensitive of the two — and
# acts in two tiers: warn once per silent episode, then kill the run's whole
# process tree, restore the last committed checkpoint and resume from the ledger.
#
#   * STALE MTIME ALONE NEVER KILLS. A single long dispatch that makes no tool
#     calls looks exactly like a hang from the outside, so the kill is gated on a
#     SECOND signal — the process tree's summed %CPU. Above the threshold the run
#     is busy rather than hung and the kill is deferred to a later pass. The
#     accepted trade-off is stated where the check is: a pathological
#     CPU-SPINNING hang is deferred indefinitely, which is far rarer than the
#     silent wait-forever hang this pass exists for.
#   * THE DESCENDANT SET IS CAPTURED BEFORE THE KILL. Signalling the registry's
#     pid ends the subshell but leaves the agent it was waiting on ORPHANED
#     rather than terminated (see spawn_engine, where that behaviour is recorded
#     as measured), and once the subshell is gone its children have reparented
#     and can no longer be enumerated through it. So the tree is collected while
#     the parent is still alive, the subshell is signalled FIRST — so it cannot
#     proceed into classify_run_exit and stamp a status this teardown did not
#     intend — and the pre-captured descendants are signalled after it.
#   * THE RESET-AND-RESUME IS SAFE BECAUSE OF THE FLOWS' COMMIT-PER-UNIT
#     INVARIANT: HEAD is always a valid checkpoint, so `git reset --hard HEAD`
#     discards only the dead dispatch's UNCOMMITTED work, which the resumed run
#     re-does from the committed ledger or checklist. Restarts are counted per
#     run and capped; past the cap, or with the working copy gone, the run is
#     marked `failed` with the reason in the notification instead of restarted.
#   * IT IS SKIPPED ENTIRELY WHILE A USAGE HOLD IS IN EFFECT, because the usage
#     machinery owns run state for as long as that marker is there.
#
# THE USAGE GATE ACTS ON THE ONE SIGNAL NO RUN CAN OBSERVE ABOUT ITSELF. The
# rate limits it exists for are ACCOUNT-GLOBAL, and they are reported as
# `rate_limit_event` records on a run's OWN headless stream — which that run
# cannot read, because it is the thing producing it. The watcher already tees
# every stream to `<log>.stream.jsonl`, so it is the only component positioned to
# see the account's state at all. It therefore makes ONE global decision from the
# newest events across every live run and applies it to ALL of them, through the
# ordinary pause protocol and nothing else:
#
#   * IT NEVER KILLS A RUN, and it never invents a mechanism. It tags each running
#     record `paused_by=usage` with its `usage_resume_at`, then drops
#     `<state_dir>/PAUSE` into its working copy; the engine yields at its
#     next clean checkpoint, writes PAUSE_ACK, and classify_run_exit marks it
#     `paused` — the same path a hand-dropped PAUSE takes. Once the window has
#     reset the gate drops `<state_dir>/RESUME`, and the pause-resume pass above
#     re-launches the run with no further involvement from here.
#   * A TAGGED PAUSE WHOSE RESET TIME IS MISSING IS GIVEN THE FALLBACK — the
#     same hour the pause side assumes when no reset was reported — written,
#     logged and reported once, and it then resumes on the wall clock like any
#     other.
#   * A RUN PAUSED BY HAND IS NEVER AUTO-RESUMED. The resume side acts on the
#     `paused_by=usage` tag alone, and a hand pause carries no tag.
#   * WHILE A PAUSE IS IN EFFECT THE HOLD MARKER IS UP, which is what defers a
#     fresh inbox drop (it stays in the inbox) and skips the watchdog above:
#     launching into a full window spends a run on an immediate refusal. A
#     REMOTE drop is dispatched through the hold — the job gates itself (see
#     REMOTE DISPATCH). The hold is bounded by each pause's recorded or repaired
#     `usage_resume_at`: it comes down on the pass that drops RESUME.
#   * THE WINDOW TYPES ARE ASSESSED INDEPENDENTLY — the 5-hour one and the
#     rolling weekly one — so a 5-hour window that has just reset cannot mask a
#     weekly window sitting at its cap. The worst state across every window of
#     every live run wins, and so does the LATEST BINDING reset among the windows
#     at it — the overage window's reset while `isUsingOverage`, the event's own
#     otherwise, because that is the one that has to pass before work resumes.
#
# THE GATE ABOVE IS PER REPOSITORY. THE LANE BELOW IS PER MACHINE. The gate
# assesses THIS repository's runs, pauses THIS repository's runs, and writes
# nothing outside this repository's state directory — but the window it is
# reasoning about belongs to the ACCOUNT, and two watchers on one machine would
# each reach their own conclusion about it separately: one pauses, the other
# keeps spending the shared window, the first wakes into a window that is still
# full and re-pauses. So every gate pass PUBLISHES its assessment — the same
# `<state> <resume_at>` pair it already computes — into one machine-level record,
# and the three passes that START work (a fresh inbox drop, a park resume, a
# pause resume) CONSULT that record before acting — and, only when
# USAGE_LANE_LOCK_ENABLED=1, also acquire a single machine-level lane. A remote
# drop, a remote park resume and a remote pause resume consult neither (see
# REMOTE DISPATCH). Both live
# under
#
#   ${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/autonomous-sdlc-harness/
#
# and lib/harness-run-lib.sh owns their format; docs/watcher.md states it.
#
#   * TWO KNOBS, AND NEITHER LIMIT IS DERIVABLE FROM THE OTHER. The published
#     assessment COORDINATES and is on by default (USAGE_LANE_STATE_ENABLED=1).
#     The advisory lock SERIALIZES which repository on this machine starts, is
#     opt-in and is OFF by default (USAGE_LANE_LOCK_ENABLED=0), so as shipped
#     several armed repositories run concurrently. MAX_PARALLEL_RUNS bounds HOW
#     MANY runs one repository has in flight. A repository holding the lane still
#     obeys its own cap; one that cannot take it starts nothing, however much of
#     its own capacity is free.
#   * WITH THE LOCK ENABLED, IT IS A PRECONDITION ON STARTING, NEVER A SECOND
#     PAUSE MECHANISM. Nothing here pauses, kills or re-tags a run because of the
#     lane: a watcher that cannot take it DEFERS exactly as it defers for its own
#     cap — the inbox file stays in the inbox, the registry record is untouched,
#     and the next pass asks again.
#   * WITH THE LOCK ENABLED, IT IS RELEASED THE MOMENT THIS REPOSITORY HAS
#     NOTHING LIVE, in `tick`, so a queued repository waits one poll interval
#     rather than for a whole run; and a watcher that died holding it loses it to
#     the library's stale-breaker — an owning pid that is gone AND a record past
#     the short ceiling, or any record past the long one. Never on a dead pid
#     alone: a one-shot `tick` starts a run that outlives it and exits, so its
#     pid is gone within the second while its run is still going.
#
# WHAT IT COMMITS, AND WHAT IT POINTEDLY DOES NOT. A dropped task prompt and a
# dropped docs checklist are copied into the run's working copy and COMMITTED
# there before the run starts, through the same commit wrapper every other
# unattended commit point calls: the engine's own "working tree clean"
# precondition has to be honest from its very first step, and a prompt left
# uncommitted is lost when the branch reaches a pull request. A dropped REVIEW
# file is placed and NEVER committed — the flow's own commits pick it up — on a
# local run; a remote one commits it (see REMOTE DISPATCH). On a LOCAL run both
# commit paths are non-blocking: a failed commit or push is one WARNING line in
# the log and the run launches anyway, because that failure has to be visible and
# must never cost the run. On a remote run it blocks the dispatch (see REMOTE
# DISPATCH).
#
# REMOTE DISPATCH. With `execution.target` `github-actions` — read per inbox
# file from the configuration in effect at the drop, an unresolvable answer
# being `local` with one log line — a drop is prepared exactly as a local one
# (working copy, artifact placed, committed and pushed) and then handed to
# `remote-run.sh dispatch` instead of spawn_engine, by launch_remote_run. It
# opens no live-log window and spawns nothing.
#
#   * SKIPPED FOR A REMOTE DROP: the usage hold, the concurrency cap and the
#     machine lane. The job gates itself, and no local component gates a remote
#     run. The kill switch still defers it, and a parked, paused or park-loop
#     record still rejects it.
#   * THE RECORD CARRIES `execution: github-actions`, and a run keeps the
#     execution it started with for its whole life: the record's field, never
#     the current key, is what later passes read. Before the duplicate test on
#     such a record, `remote-run.sh sync` refreshes its status (best-effort).
#   * THE REVIEW IS COMMITTED, on a remote run only: the job checks out
#     `origin/<branch>`, so a review left uncommitted would not reach it, and a
#     job boundary before the flow's own commit would lose it. The working copy
#     is first fast-forwarded to `origin/<branch>`, because the job, not this
#     copy, is where the branch advanced.
#   * A FAILED COMMIT OR PUSH BLOCKS A REMOTE DISPATCH, for all three artifacts,
#     while it never blocks a local launch. A local run executes in the working
#     copy that holds the file; a remote job sees only what was pushed. An
#     identical re-drop still skips the commit, but its push must still land —
#     the earlier drop's push may be the one that failed. push-branch.sh exits
#     0 on every path, so "landed" is read as `origin/<branch>` equal to HEAD.
#   * NOTHING LOCAL WATCHES, GATES, RESTARTS OR RESUMES A REMOTE RUN ON ITS
#     OWN. Skipped for such a record: the vanished-process reconcile, the cap
#     count, the stall watchdog, both halves of the usage gate, and the lane's
#     idle release.
#   * NOTHING IS RELAYED. The user's commands send pause, resume and answer to
#     GitHub themselves through `remote-run.sh`, so no file in a mirror is a
#     request this script acts on: the parked, paused and park-loop passes skip
#     a remote record outright, sending nothing and changing nothing.
#
# A remote run's local working copy is a MIRROR that `remote-run.sh sync`
# fills; it is stopped through `remote-run.sh stop`.
#
# THE AGENT BINARY IS REACHED THROUGH ONE VARIABLE, `${HARNESS_AGENT_CLI:-claude}`,
# resolved once below. It defaults to the real CLI, so an operator sees no
# difference. It exists so the launch and exit-classification paths can be
# exercised against a STUB that prints a canned `stream-json` transcript and
# exits with a chosen code: every other route into them is a real multi-hour
# session, which is exactly how a classifier ships untested. It is a deliberate
# test seam, and the only one here. It is also THE ONE PLACE THE ENGINE BINARY IS
# CHOSEN, and deliberately the only one.
# Choosing a binary is not by itself an engine abstraction: the flags below, the
# settings-file format `--settings` names, the first-message command form and the
# `stream-json` event stream this script parses are engine-bound too, so pointing
# this variable at a different runtime does not make one work. ARCHITECTURE.md,
# sections "Where the engine is reached — the launch path" and "Where the engine
# is reached — assets and configuration", enumerate the full coupling surface.
#
# ANCHORS ARE DERIVED, NEVER REMEMBERED. The repository is resolved from this
# script's own location, and the MAIN checkout — the first working copy git lists
# — is the one that holds the inbox, the logs, the registry and the kill switch,
# so every run is tailable and stoppable from ONE place while executing in its own
# sibling working copy — except under `job`, where the main checkout and the
# working copy are the same directory, the job's own checkout (see JOB MODE);
# and except for a record with `execution: github-actions`, whose run executes
# in a GitHub Actions job, whose local working copy is a mirror that
# `remote-run.sh sync` fills, and which is stopped through `remote-run.sh stop`
# (see REMOTE DISPATCH). Every run-artifact path under it comes from the configured `stateDir` through
# lib/harness-run-lib.sh; none of them is spelled here.
#
# IT REFUSES TO START ON A CONFIGURATION IT CANNOT READ. A watcher that guessed
# would watch a directory nobody drops files into, log where nobody tails, and
# honor a kill switch nobody can reach — silently, for as long as it runs. So an
# unreadable library, a location outside a repository, or a `harness.config.json`
# that is absent, unparsable, multi-document, missing `defaultBranch` or beyond
# the `jq` floor ends the process with ONE line on stderr and a non-zero status,
# before anything is created. Those lines go to stderr rather than to the watcher
# log, because the log's location is exactly what could not be resolved; the
# service manager's own capture is where they land.
#
# THE OPERATOR OVERRIDE CHANNEL, AND WHAT BELONGS IN IT.
#
#   ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/autonomous-sdlc-harness/watcher.env
#
# is sourced when it is a file, and its absence is a silent no-op. It exists so an
# operator can change a tunable WITHOUT editing a generated file — a repository-
# scoped tunable would be a `harness.config.json` key and there is none, and this
# location survives a `daemon install` that re-renders the service unit. Its scope
# is the tunables below and nothing else BY INTENT; the mechanism is assignment
# order, so a value resolved above this point is reachable from the file whether
# or not it is a tunable. It is sourced AFTER the anchors are resolved, so it
# cannot move the inbox, the logs or the kill switch.
#
#   * It is sourced under `set -a`, so ANYTHING SET THERE ALSO REACHES A CHILD
#     PROCESS — the notifier, and later the engine. No value from it is ever
#     echoed or logged.
#   * CREDENTIALS DO NOT BELONG HERE. The push target lives in the machine-local
#     `push.env` beside it, which autonomous-notify.sh resolves for itself.
#   * THE FILE WINS OVER AN INHERITED ENVIRONMENT VALUE, which is the opposite of
#     the credential file's rule. It is sourced BEFORE the `${VAR:-default}` lines
#     below, so its plain assignment overwrites what the environment carried in
#     and the defaulting line then keeps it. Stated because it is surprising:
#     `POLL_INTERVAL_SECS=7 autonomous-watcher.sh status` reports 99 when the file
#     says 99. To test a value ad hoc, edit or move the file.
#
# The resolved values are printed by `status`, one line, names and values only —
# so the channel is observable rather than merely documented.
#
# THE REGISTRY IS A CONTRACT, NOT AN IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL.
# `<state_dir>/autonomous_logs/registry.json` is a single JSON object shaped
# `{"runs": {"<branch>": {…}}}`, and the shipped commands read it in that shape
# (`.runs["<branch>"].status`) to report a branch's state. The `.runs` wrapper and
# the status vocabulary `running | parked | park_loop | paused | completed |
# failed` are
# therefore fixed: renaming either breaks readers this script never sees.
#
# THE KILL SWITCH IS THE OPERATOR'S, AND THIS SCRIPT NEVER DELETES IT.
# `<state_dir>/AUTONOMOUS_STOP` in the main checkout stops the watcher from
# launching or resuming ANY run, and it is removed by hand — a watcher that
# cleared its own brake would restart the very runs it was told to stop.
# Relaying a remote run's pause is the one action that still runs under the
# brake, because it starts nothing (see REMOTE DISPATCH). It is distinct from
# the per-run `<state_dir>/STOP` inside one working copy, which halts one run.
#
# WHO RUNS IT. The service manager (`daemon install` renders the unit), or a
# person by hand for a single `tick` or a `status` — and one other runner, the
# remote workflow's harness step, invoking `job` with HARNESS_JOB_MODE=1 (see
# JOB MODE). NEVER a dispatched agent:
# its basename is on the script-allowlist guard's `DENY_SCRIPT_BASENAMES`, so
# that guard withholds the permit rather than granting one, and the generated
# permission profile emits no rule for it either — an agent that could start runs
# could start runs about itself.
#
# JOB MODE. `job <branch> <engine> <resume>` runs EXACTLY ONE run inside a
# GitHub Actions job's own checkout, through the same spawn_engine launch line,
# stream tee, classify_run_exit, park-loop guard, stall watchdog and usage gate
# a local run gets — the job does for itself what this daemon does locally.
#
#   * REFUSED UNLESS HARNESS_JOB_MODE=1. The stall watchdog's `git reset --hard
#     HEAD` acts on the checkout the job runs in, and job mode treats that
#     checkout as both the main one and the working copy; run by accident in a
#     developer's checkout it would discard work. Only the workflow sets it.
#   * OFF: the inbox pass, the cleanup sweep, the live-log window, and the
#     machine lane (both halves). The lane is local-only, and on a hosted runner
#     its directory would not outlive the job. They are forced off AFTER the
#     override channel and the tunable defaults, so no environment value turns
#     them back on.
#   * THE REGISTRY is the checkout's gitignored one, ephemeral by construction;
#     what must cross a job boundary rides in the remote state bundle's
#     `status.json`, restored to `autonomous_logs/remote_status.json` before the
#     job starts. Park-loop cycles, the resume baseline and the stall-restart
#     count are seeded from it; the auto-resume count only when
#     HARNESS_INPUT_CHAIN is above 0, because a chain of 0 is a user's own
#     dispatch; `chain` never — every write records this job's own input.
#   * THE PAUSE NOTE belongs to the run that wrote it. Before its own first
#     write, the job reads the restored `remote_status.json`'s `status` and
#     `engine`. In job mode, a carried `PAUSE_PROGRESS.md` is kept only when
#     the job's `resume` is `pause`, the restored `remote_status.json` says
#     `status: paused`, and its `engine` equals the job's engine. In every other
#     case — a fresh launch (`resume none`), an answer resume (`resume
#     answer`), a pause resume whose previous job did not pause (a stop or a
#     kill), or a different engine — it is moved aside, never deleted, to
#     `<state_dir>/autonomous_logs/remote_superseded/<epoch>[-<n>]/PAUSE_PROGRESS.md`.
#     The move is lib/harness-run-lib.sh's `hr_remote_move_aside`; this script
#     writes nothing under `remote_superseded/` itself. Separately, a pause
#     resume whose previous job did not pause, or paused for a different
#     engine, is re-launched with a clause saying there is no pause note,
#     whether or not a note was carried (`pause_note_stale` in the registry).
#   * IT WRITES `remote_status.json` with decision `continue` before the spawn,
#     so a job killed mid-run leaves a bundle that says continue, again after
#     every successful control poll, and once more when the run leaves
#     `running` for good, with the decision below. It then prints
#     `job: <status> <decision>` and exits 0.
#   * TWO PASSES ONLY A JOB RUNS, while the run is `running`, each dropping
#     `<state_dir>/PAUSE` at most once per job and recording `pause_reason`:
#     the CONTROL POLL (`remote-run.sh pause-requested <branch>
#     <control_polled_at>`, every REMOTE_CONTROL_POLL_SECS) -> `user`; and the
#     BUDGET — REMOTE_SELF_PAUSE_AFTER_SECS past HARNESS_JOB_STARTED_EPOCH, set
#     only on a hosted runner -> `budget`. `control_polled_at` STARTS at the
#     restored bundle's under HARNESS_INPUT_CHAIN above 0, else at this run's own
#     `createdAt` (`remote-run.sh run-created-at "$GITHUB_RUN_ID"`), else at
#     HARNESS_JOB_STARTED_EPOCH — NEVER at the job's own start alone, which
#     would lose a pause sent while the job was queued. That starting bound is
#     the job's FLOOR. The verb's exit decides: `0` a pause, `5` none — each
#     advances the bound to the larger of the floor and the epoch taken just
#     before the query less CONTROL_POLL_OVERLAP_SECS, so a run the listing
#     shows late is still read; anything else, `1` included, is a failed poll,
#     which advances nothing and pauses nothing. Every poll logs one line,
#     `job: control poll of '<branch>' since <since> (exit <rc>): <last line>`.
#   * THE RUNNER WAIT: the job logs HARNESS_JOB_STARTED_EPOCH less this run's
#     `createdAt` — read once per job, the same read the control poll's
#     starting bound takes. On a re-run attempt (`GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT` above 1)
#     that `createdAt` is the first attempt's, so the wait is not measured and
#     no note is added. A wait of at least RUNNER_WAIT_NOTE_SECS is noted on
#     the `resumed` comment the job posts as it starts, never on a later
#     automatic resume's. The budget already starts at
#     HARNESS_JOB_STARTED_EPOCH, so a wait costs no budget.
#   * THE DECISION, when the run leaves `running`: `paused` for `budget` ->
#     `continue`; for `user` -> `stop`; by the usage gate (`usage`) -> a lost
#     `usage_resume_at` is first given the gate's fallback and reported as
#     assumed, then WAIT IN THE JOB, the gate's own auto-resume and
#     resume_paused_runs relaunching it, when the reset falls before
#     HARNESS_JOB_DEADLINE_EPOCH and the runner is self-hosted or the wait is at
#     most REMOTE_WAIT_MAX_SECS, else `wait-poller`. A wait still paused
#     REMOTE_WAIT_MAX_SECS past the gate's last chance to resume it — the later
#     of that reset and its own start, plus USAGE_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECS and
#     POLL_INTERVAL_SECS, the most the throttled gate can lag the reset — ends
#     in `wait-poller` with one notification, on every runner; with no pause
#     requested — the run's own API-overload
#     self-pause (`overload`) -> auto-resume, else `stop`. `failed` ->
#     auto-resume unless the stall watchdog gave up, else `stop`. Every other
#     status -> `stop`. An empty HARNESS_JOB_DEADLINE_EPOCH bounds nothing.
#   * THE BOUNDED AUTO-RESUME: while `auto_resumes` is below
#     REMOTE_AUTO_RESUME_MAX and REMOTE_AUTO_RESUME_DELAY_SECS from now is
#     before the deadline, sleep that delay, count one, and relaunch from the
#     committed ledger through begin_pause_resume and `spawn_engine … "" 1`. The
#     count resets on any user action — see `auto_resumes` in the registry.
#     A resume taken after the hosted budget's PAUSE was dropped re-drops it,
#     so the relaunched session still yields at the budget.
#   * NOTIFICATIONS name the user's next action instead of a runner path: a
#     parked run's `/autonomous-sdlc-harness:branch-answer <branch>`, a park
#     loop's `/autonomous-sdlc-harness:branch-status <branch>`, a `user` or
#     exhausted `overload` pause's `/autonomous-sdlc-harness:branch-resume
#     <branch>`, a usage pause's reset time. A `budget` pause sends NO `paused`,
#     and the next job no `resumed` for it: a chained continuation is not an
#     event the user acts on. classify_run_exit's `paused` arm notifies only a
#     `user` pause; job mode sends the others once it has decided. Their titles
#     carry HARNESS_REMOTE_SLUG when set. Each job-mode event except `failed` is
#     also passed to `remote-run.sh report` as it happens, and `failed` once,
#     when the job ends `failed`; `report` comments on the run's pull request or
#     issue and moves its state label when `forge` is `github`; `autonomous-notify.sh`
#     is unchanged, and `completed` is reported by the workflow's `deliver` step
#     after the push.
#   * THE PROGRESS PASS (job_progress_pass): every `running` pass reads the
#     flow-progress ledger the flow pushes in this checkout through
#     lib/harness-run-lib.sh's `hr_ledger_phases`, and calls `remote-run.sh
#     report progress <branch>` when that reading differs from the last one
#     this job reported, and once more when the job ends, so a tick landing
#     after the last poll is still reported. It reads nothing from GitHub to
#     decide and keeps no state across jobs: the render is deterministic and
#     `report progress` edits the comment only when its body differs, so a
#     job's first pass syncs once and a budget continuation posts nothing new
#     unless a phase moved — consistent with `docs/github-run-control.md` ->
#     §5's *The budget is silent*, because what is posted is a phase, not the
#     continuation. What is posted, where, and whether at all is `report
#     progress`'s to decide; the watcher decides only when to call it.
#   * THE INTERACTIVE-TEST PHASE IS SKIPPED, not run: a runner has no browser
#     wiring, application dependencies or QA credentials for it. With
#     `phases.qa` true, the task and user_review launch prompts gain one clause
#     telling the flow to record the skip on the ledger's `remote-skipped:` line
#     and skip Phase E / R4, and a `completed` run's one notification names the
#     skip and `/autonomous-sdlc-harness:branch-qa-test <branch>` as the local
#     route. The docs engine has no such phase; a local launch gets no clause.

#                    After the stub exits, all three pairs are under

#                 watcher.log carries a `resume made no progress (cycle 2/2: …)`
#                 line and the `park loop` line. Answer the new question and tick
#                 -> the stub is NOT launched and the record is unchanged. Create
#                 clarifications/feat_x/PARK_LOOP_CLEAR and tick -> the file is
#                 gone, the `park loop cleared` line is logged, and the run
#                 resumes in that same pass. PARK_LOOP_MAX_CYCLES=0 -> it never

#                    second tick adds none; `touch`ing the .stream.jsonl clears
#                    stall_warned again. With the back-date in place and
#                    STALL_WARN_SECS=1 STALL_KILL_SECS=2, the tick kills the stub

#                    `running` again and the stub's saved prompt carries the
#                    pause-resume clause. A stub SPINNING on CPU instead of

# Minimal-environment bootstrap. A service manager does NOT source an interactive

# after what was inherited — never ahead of it, so nothing the unit captured is
# demoted and whatever the caller put first stays first — then activate a version
# manager when one is installed. Both best-effort, both silent, and NEITHER
# naming a toolchain: which toolchain a repository needs is its own
# configuration's business, not this script's. APPENDING IS WHAT MAKES THAT TRUE:
# prepending pushed `/usr/bin` ahead of a `$HOME`-rooted shims directory, so the
# system copy of a version-managed tool won. And on a unit with no environment
# key at all, the appended directories are still what resolves `jq`, a Homebrew
# toolchain and an agent CLI under `~/.local/bin`, none of which lives in
# `/usr/bin`, so each is still REACHED. What the bare shape gives up is
# PRECEDENCE against `/usr/bin`: a Homebrew copy of a tool `/usr/bin` also holds
# — `ruby`, `bundle`, `python3`, `curl`, `make`, `git` — used to win under the
# prepend and now loses. That is the price of never demoting what the caller
# put first, and a unit that renders a captured `PATH` at all does not pay it.

#                       a resume of a run that already read them. It is NOT a
#                       defect on a `paused` record: the pause branch returns
#                       before the archival and leaves it set on purpose,
#                       because a pause mid park-resume left those answers
#                       unconsumed. The pause resume never writes this field —
#                       a pause is not an answer. It is not the only record of
#                       the consumed set: `launch_answered_set` re-derives it
#   launch_answered_set every top-level answered pair's index when the current
#                       session launched (`1 2`), which is the set a re-entering

#                       non-pause exit, and left set by a pause exit. The remote
#                       bundle does not carry it: the next job's launch

#   resume_kind         `answer` when the park resume launched the current
#                       session, `pause` when the pause resume did, and empty

#                       non-pause exit; it is how the park-loop guard counts only

#                       `status.json` vocabulary, each value written by job mode
#                       (and copied into a local record by `remote-run.sh sync`):
#                       `usage` the usage gate requested it; `budget` job mode
#                       did, REMOTE_SELF_PAUSE_AFTER_SECS into a hosted job;

#                       `overload` nobody requested it — the run's own
#                       API-overload self-pause. `user` and `budget` are written

    # honest from its very first step, and what stops the prompt from being left
    # dangling-uncommitted and lost when the branch reaches a pull request.

    # Only the prompt is staged, by explicit path — never `git add -A` or
    # `git add .`, matching the no-blanket-add rule every unattended commit point
    # in this family follows. The nothing-staged pre-check is what makes
    # an identical re-drop of an already-committed prompt a no-op instead of an
    # empty commit; when there IS a diff, the WRAPPER does the real staging and
    # the commit, so this commit point inherits its protected-branch refusal

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE USAGE GATE. The header states what it acts on, why only the watcher can see
# that signal, and that this pass's boundary is ONE repository. Two correctness
# invariants shape everything below, and neither is optional:
#
#   1. STALENESS. A `rate_limit_event` is actionable only while its BINDING
#      window is still open — `overageResetsAt` when `isUsingOverage`, otherwise
#      the event's own `resetsAt`. An event naming an ELAPSED window is
#      downgraded to `allowed`. This is not tidiness. A paused run's stream is
#      FROZEN at the pause, so its last event stays the pre-pause warning until
#      the resumed engine emits a fresh one — without the downgrade the gate
#      re-pauses the very run it just resumed, on every resume, forever.
#   2. RESUME-TAG PRESERVATION. `paused_by=usage` and `usage_resume_at` are the
#      ONLY state the wall-clock resume reads, and they are written when the
#      PAUSE is REQUESTED — while the record is still `running` for however many
#      passes the engine takes to reach a clean boundary. So the stale-tag
#      cleanup must NOT clear them until the pause sentinels are gone, or the run
#      is stranded: paused, untagged, and never resumed by anything.
#
# The event shape this parses, and the parts of it that are NOT safe to assume:
#
#   {status, rateLimitType, resetsAt, isUsingOverage, overageStatus?,
#    overageResetsAt?, utilization?}
#
# `status` moves allowed -> allowed_warning -> rejected as a window fills, and
# `isUsingOverage` flips true once overage billing engages. `overageStatus` is
# ABSENT in the allowed_warning state — measured, not assumed — so `.status` and
# `.isUsingOverage` are the only keys ever triggered on. `rateLimitType` is
# `five_hour` or `seven_day` today, and an UNKNOWN type is passed through rather
# than dropped: a limit type this parser has never seen must still be able to
# pause a run.
#
# Like the passes above and unlike running_count, this is a PURE SIDE-EFFECT
# pass — nothing captures its stdout, so `log` is safe inside it.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Echo one "<status> <isUsingOverage> <resetsAt> <overageResetsAt>" line per
# rate-limit WINDOW this run has seen, or nothing when the stream file or the
# events are unavailable. The LAST event of each window is what counts — the
# five_hour one, the seven_day one, and any other type, passed through unchanged.
# A seven_day `allowed_warning` below USAGE_SEVEN_DAY_PAUSE_PCT utilization is
# downgraded to `allowed` inside the jq program, because the weekly warning fires
# from about half the budget and must not drive a pause on its own.
#
# THE READ IS BOUNDED, AND THAT BOUND IS A RESOURCE DECISION RATHER THAN AN
# OPTIMIZATION: the raw stream grows for the entire life of a run — hours, and
# every event of it — and this function runs for every live run on every gate
# pass. Reading the whole file would make the cost of assessing grow with the
# length of the run it is assessing. The tail is far longer than any burst of
# rate-limit events, so the last event per window is always inside it. Never
# replace it with a whole-file read.
