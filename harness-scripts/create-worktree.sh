#!/usr/bin/env bash
# create-worktree.sh — create the sibling working copy a run executes in, and
# bootstrap it by handing off to setup-worktree.sh.
#
# THE TWO MODES, AND WHEN EACH IS USED.
#
#   default      Start a NEW branch: fetch the configured default branch, add a
#                worktree with `-b <branch>` off `origin/<default branch>`,
#                bootstrap it, then PUSH the branch so the remote has it from
#                the first moment. This is what the watcher calls when a prompt
#                arrives for a branch that does not exist yet.
#   --no-bootstrap  Skip the bootstrap. Alone, a variant of default mode: cut
#                and push the new branch the same way. With `--existing`, check
#                out the existing branch and never push. Its callers are
#                `remote-run.sh start` (a new branch) and `remote-run.sh review`
#                (an existing one), each of which only places and commits one
#                file: such a copy runs nothing, so a dependency install would
#                cost minutes and could fail the placement for a reason
#                unrelated to the task. It installs no worktree-scoped pre-push
#                backstop — the push a caller makes is of a branch it has
#                already judged not protected, and every later commit goes
#                through `commit-on-branch.sh` and `push-branch.sh`, which refuse
#                a protected branch themselves. An existing branch's copy that a
#                person or a local run works in still wants the bootstrap, so
#                `--existing` alone keeps it; `--no-bootstrap` is for a copy that
#                only places and commits one file.
#   --existing   Check out an EXISTING branch — local, or DWIM-created from
#                `origin/<branch>` when only the remote ref exists — bootstrap
#                it, and NEVER push. This is what the watcher calls to recreate
#                a working copy for a branch whose original one was removed (a
#                merged-and-cleaned-up branch coming back for a follow-up run),
#                and the asymmetry is the point: the branch already has a
#                history somebody else may have advanced, so this mode reads the
#                remote and never writes to it. It also never names the default
#                branch.
#
# WHERE THE WORKTREE GOES. `<work_root>/<projectName>-<sanitized branch>`,
# derived by the shared library rather than assembled here — the SAME
# derivation the generated permission profile's sibling-worktree glob is
# materialized from, so a working copy this creates is one an unattended run's
# profile matches. The optional second argument overrides the directory, and an
# override is for a person: a path outside that derivation is not what the
# profile matches, so an unattended run passes none.
#
# WHY `set -e` IS RIGHT HERE, AND NOWHERE ELSE IN THIS SET. Every other script
# written into the scripts directory runs `set -uo pipefail` without `-e`,
# because a wrapper or a long-lived watcher that exits on the first non-zero
# probe stops doing its job. This one is a short, strictly ordered sequence in
# which every step is a precondition of the next: bootstrapping a half-created
# worktree, or pushing a branch whose dependency install failed, is worse than
# stopping (a `--no-bootstrap` cut simply has no bootstrap step in its
# sequence). So a failing step aborts the script with that step's own status —
# and the worktree it had already created is LEFT IN PLACE for inspection,
# because removing a working copy is a decision this script does not get to
# make silently.
#
# FAIL CLOSED ON A CONFIGURATION IT CANNOT READ. The directory name, the default
# branch and the bootstrap path all come from `harness.config.json` at run time,
# through `lib/harness-run-lib.sh`, and none of them has a remembered fallback:
# a guessed default branch would branch a run off the wrong history, and a
# guessed directory would create a working copy the permission profile does not
# match. An unreadable or absent configuration is therefore a refusal that
# creates nothing.
#
# WHAT IT NEVER DOES. It never pushes in `--existing` mode. It never deletes,
# empties, reuses or moves an existing directory, and never passes a force flag
# to `git worktree add`. It never checks out a branch that is already checked
# out somewhere — it names that working copy and refuses, because git would
# refuse anyway and a bare git error does not say what to do about it. It is run
# by the watcher or by a person, not by a dispatched agent, so it has no entry
# in the generated permission profile — a CALLING CONVENTION, NOT A GATE: its
# basename is not on the script-allowlist guard's `DENY_SCRIPT_BASENAMES`, and
# that guard grants independently of the profile, so an agent invoking this path
# under `scriptsDir` is auto-allowed today — but only in a PLAIN invocation:
# that guard's construct scan withholds the allow, silently, from any command
# carrying `$(…)` (a branch name taken from `$(git rev-parse …)`, say), a
# backtick, `|`, `<`, a braced form other than a bare `${IDENT}`, or a `>` that
# is neither a descriptor duplication (`2>&1`, `>&2`, `2>&-`) nor a redirection
# to the literal `/dev/null`.
#
# Usage: create-worktree.sh [--existing] [--no-bootstrap] <branch-name> [worktree-dir]
#   --existing     check out an existing branch instead of creating a new one
#   --no-bootstrap skip the bootstrap: alone, create and push a new branch; with
#                  --existing, check out the existing branch and never push
#   <branch-name>  the branch to run on
#   [worktree-dir] optional override; relative paths resolve against $PWD
#
# Exit map a caller can switch on:
#
#   0  the worktree is ready (and, in default mode or under `--no-bootstrap`
#      without `--existing`, the branch was pushed)
#   1  usage error / the library or the configuration could not be read
#   2  refusal — nothing was created: `--existing` and the branch is nowhere;
#      the branch is already checked out in another working copy (which is
#      named); or default mode with no `origin` remote, or no
#      `origin/<default branch>` to branch from
#   4  the working copy was created but could not be bootstrapped (never under
#      `--no-bootstrap`, with or without `--existing`, which resolves no
#      bootstrap) — it has no
#      dependency install and no pre-push backstop, is LEFT IN PLACE for
#      inspection, and in default mode the branch was NOT pushed, because this
#      exit precedes the push step. In default mode the local
#      `refs/heads/<branch>` that `worktree add -b` created is left behind WITH
#      the directory and is NOT deleted by `git worktree remove`, so `4` denotes
#      two artefacts and a re-run that clears only the first refuses with git's
#      own `a branch named … already exists`. What buys the reach is exiting
#      NON-ZERO at all — the watcher branches on that at each of its three call
#      sites, logs a `create-worktree.sh … failed for '<branch>'` line and
#      archives the drop, which a line on stderr never reached. The distinct
#      status is for a caller that wants to tell an un-bootstrapped working copy
#      apart from a refusal that created nothing; no shipped caller does that yet
#   *  any other status is the failing `git` or bootstrap step's own (`set -e`);
#      the worktree may exist and be un-bootstrapped. Kept deliberately broad
#      when the remote cases moved up to 2: the remote is the common cause, not
#      the only one, and every other step still surfaces as git's own status
