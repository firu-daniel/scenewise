#!/usr/bin/env bash
# docs-search-server.sh — start the docs-retrieval MCP server for the checkout
# this script sits in, on the backend `docs.retrievalBackend` selects.
#
# WHO RUNS IT. The agent runner, from the `harness-docs` entry `init` writes into
# `.mcp.json` when `docs.retrieval` is on — never a dispatched agent's Bash call,
# so its row in `cli/src/generators/outerLoopScripts.ts` is
# `agentInvocable: false` and the generated permission profile carries no entry
# for it.
#
# STDOUT BELONGS TO THE MCP TRANSPORT. Nothing here may print to stdout: a stray
# byte there is a malformed frame for the client. Every diagnostic goes to
# stderr.
#
# WHICH SERVER. Two backends, chosen by `docs.retrievalBackend` read at run
# time, with no fallback between them and no fallback to any other
# installation. The key is read ONLY WHEN `phases.docs` and `docs.retrieval` are
# both `true` (`hr_docs_retrieval_applies`, the shell mirror of
# `retrievalApplies`): `init` merges `.mcp.json` and removes nothing, so this
# entry outlives turning retrieval off, and with the gate closed the TypeScript
# runtime is `exec`ed whatever the key holds. `typescript`, or the key absent,
# `exec`s the machine-shared runtime's `docs serve`; `doctor`'s
# `retrieval-dependencies` check and `init`'s install both key on the same entry
# file this script tests. `python` starts the Python package's stdio server.
# This script checks no database and runs no `self-check`: grading the backend's
# prerequisites is `doctor`'s. `PATH` is settled through the library's fallback
# list first, because the starter is the agent runner rather than a login shell.
#
# WHY THE PYTHON BRANCH IS NOT `exec`ED. Its failure must surface as exit 3,
# which an `exec` could not report. It runs as a child with stdin passed
# explicitly, and a `TERM` or an `INT` the launcher receives is passed on to it
# as `TERM`, the signal the server stops on: bash starts a background child with
# `SIGINT` ignored when job control is off, and Python installs no handler over
# an ignored `SIGINT`, so an `INT` passed on as itself would never arrive.
#
# MIRRORS — a change to any owner below is an edit here too:
#   `retrieval/runtime` and `node_modules/autonomous-sdlc-harness/dist/cli.js`
#     mirror `RETRIEVAL_CACHE_DIRNAME`, `RETRIEVAL_RUNTIME_DIRNAME` and
#     `RUNTIME_CLI_RELATIVE` in `cli/src/retrieval/runtime.ts`;
#   `hr_cache_dir` mirrors `machineCacheDir()` in `cli/src/machine/paths.ts`;
#   `harness-docs-retrieval`, `serve-mcp`, `HARNESS_DOCS_RETRIEVAL_DATABASE_URL`,
#     the default connection string and exit 3 mirror `PYTHON_RETRIEVAL_COMMAND`,
#     `PYTHON_SERVE_SUB_COMMAND`, `PYTHON_DATABASE_URL_VARIABLE`,
#     `PYTHON_DEFAULT_DATABASE_URL` and `PYTHON_BACKEND_UNAVAILABLE_EXIT` in
#     `cli/src/retrieval/pythonBackend.ts`.
#
# Exit contract:
#   0    the Python backend exited 0
#   1    no repository at this script's location; `docs.retrievalBackend`
#        outside the enum; or, on the TypeScript backend, no runtime entry at
#        the resolved path or no cache directory to resolve it under; stderr
#        names which
#   3    the Python backend is selected but cannot serve: its command does not
#        resolve on `PATH`, or it exited non-zero; stderr names which
#   N    on the TypeScript backend, `docs serve`'s own status, through `exec`; a
#        failure to source the library exits non-zero before that, on stderr only
