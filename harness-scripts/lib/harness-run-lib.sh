#!/usr/bin/env bash
# harness-run-lib.sh — the one place every generated outer-loop script resolves
# the repository it is operating on, reads that repository's
# `harness.config.json` at run time, answers "is this branch protected?",
# routes an inbox filename to its engine and branch (`hr_inbox_route_var`),
# derives a branch name from a title (`hr_derive_branch`), judges whether a
# path lies strictly inside the state directory's scratch directory
# (`hr_scratch_path_var`), answers whether the progress comment is on
# (`hr_progress_comments`) and which main phases a flow-progress ledger records
# as through (`hr_ledger_phases`), places a dropped
# artifact in a working copy and commits and pushes it, and derives the
# anchors (main checkout, work root, worktree directory, repo slug,
# state-dir paths) the scripts would otherwise each re-derive slightly
# differently. It also implements the run registry's reads and writes for the
# scripts that share that registry, and states the remote state bundle's format
# with the one writer and restorer every remote-execution consumer shares, and
# the GitHub route a job-side notification names beside its local command.
#
# WHO SOURCES THIS, AND HOW. Every script in the configured `scriptsDir` that
# needs this library sources it by a path computed from `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` —
# the sourcing script's own location — i.e.
#
#     . "$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)/lib/harness-run-lib.sh"
#
# and never by a hardcoded path, an assumed session root, or the plugin-root
# token the runtime substitutes into hook `command` strings and agent bodies:
# that token is not exported into a script's environment, so a script body that
# reaches for it gets an empty string under `set -u` or an unset variable
# without it. (It is deliberately not spelled out anywhere in this file; its
# literal presence here is exactly the defect this paragraph prevents.) The
# project-command wrappers and `autonomous-format-stream.sh` need nothing from
# this library and do not source it.
#
# ONE SCRIPT MUST NOT USE THAT SPELLING, AND THE REASON GENERALISES.
# `autonomous-watcher.sh` sources this file BEFORE it settles `PATH`, because its
# bootstrap calls `hr_path_with_fallbacks` below; `dirname` is not a builtin, so
# on a service-manager unit that renders no `PATH` key the fork may not resolve
# and the start fails at the one step that cannot afford a lookup. It resolves
# its own directory from `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` with a `case` strip plus the `cd`
# and `pwd` builtins instead. ANY script that sources this library ahead of its
# own `PATH` settle owes the same builtin-only form; every other script settles
# `PATH` first (or is never started by a service manager) and keeps the `dirname`
# idiom above.
#
# IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT THE PLUGIN'S LIBRARY. The guard hooks have their own
# copy of this shape. The plugin and this package install to unrelated roots, so
# neither can source the other's, and a script that tried would work on the
# machine that wrote it and nowhere else. The two files are kept in step by
# their shared contract — the three-state answer, the protected set and the
# floors below — not by sharing code.
#
# JURISDICTION. Configuration is read at `<repo_root>/harness.config.json` and
# nowhere else, where `<repo_root>` is resolved from a bare
# `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` at the directory the caller names. Nothing
# here reads an environment variable in place of a configured value, and nothing
# here writes inside a repository except through the named write exceptions
# below.
#
# THE WRITE EXCEPTIONS TO "WRITES NOTHING", AND THEIR FENCES. Each entry names
# the section that writes, the functions that write, and where. Nothing outside
# this list writes at all; a section that adds a writer adds its entry here.
#
#   1. The machine-level usage lane (the section at the bottom of this file)
#      publishes a state record and takes an advisory lock. Fence: both live
#      under `hr_lane_dir` — a machine-local path outside every repository —
#      and are written only by the `hr_lane_*` functions.
#   2. THE RUN REGISTRY writes the registry file its caller names. Fence: that
#      file is `<root>/<state_dir>/autonomous_logs/registry.json`, resolved
#      through `hr_state_path`, plus the lock directory `<file>.lock` (and its
#      `.stale.*` move-aside and `.break` mutex while a stale one is broken)
#      and the temp files
#      `.registry.*` in the registry's own directory. Written only by
#      `hr_registry_init`, `hr_registry_set`, `hr_remote_record_init` (through
#      `hr_registry_set`) and the `hr_registry_lock` / `hr_registry_unlock`
#      pair `hr_registry_set` calls.
#   3. THE REMOTE STATE BUNDLE writes the files its format lists. Fence: inside
#      `<root>/<state_dir>/` (resolved through `hr_state_dir`), only
#      `autonomous_logs/remote_status.json`, `clarifications/<branch>/`,
#      `PAUSE_PROGRESS.md`, `.flow_walker_state`, the move-aside directory
#      `autonomous_logs/remote_superseded/` and, only where nothing exists yet,
#      files under the eight planning paths `hr_remote_planning_paths` assigns;
#      outside it, only the caller-named `<out_dir>` (its `planning/` included)
#      of `hr_remote_bundle_write` and the caller-named `<out_json>`
#      of `hr_remote_status_write`. The move-aside directory receives the
#      clarification directory and `PAUSE_PROGRESS.md`, both moved there by
#      `hr_remote_move_aside` alone. Written only by `hr_remote_status_write`,
#      `hr_remote_bundle_write`, `hr_remote_bundle_restore` and
#      `hr_remote_move_aside`, and nothing there but a writer's own failed temp
#      file is ever removed.
#   4. THE ARTIFACT PLACEMENT writes one artifact into a working copy. Fence:
#      the caller-named `<worktree>/<rel>`, its parent directories and that
#      path's index entry, plus whatever the two caller-named wrappers do, plus
#      one write of its own: `hr_push_landed`'s fetch, which force-writes
#      `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` in `<worktree>`, made only after a failed
#      landing, to name the commit the remote moved to.
#      Written only by `hr_place_artifact`, `hr_commit_placed` and
#      `hr_push_landed`.
#
# MIRRORS OF `cli/src/remote/githubActions.ts`, which owns these names; a
# rename there is an edit here, byte for byte:
#   HR_REMOTE_WORKFLOW_RUN_FILE mirrors  WORKFLOW_RUN_FILE
#   HR_REMOTE_STATE_ARTIFACT    mirrors  STATE_ARTIFACT_NAME
#
# MIRROR OF `plugin/instructions/autonomous_pause_and_ledger.md` →
# `### 1.3 Templates`, which owns the flow-progress ledger's two header forms
# and its entry ids; `hr_ledger_phases` codes both, so renaming an id or a
# header form there is an edit here.
#
# A caller that calls no `hr_lane_*`, `hr_registry_init`, `hr_registry_set`,
# `hr_remote_record_init`, `hr_registry_lock`, `hr_registry_unlock`, `hr_remote_status_write`,
# `hr_remote_bundle_write`, `hr_remote_bundle_restore`, `hr_remote_move_aside`, `hr_place_artifact`,
# `hr_commit_placed` or `hr_push_landed` function still gets a library that only reads. The
# lane's ceilings are the only environment values here that carry policy, because
# the lane is machine-scoped and has no configuration key to carry them; each is
# named where it is used. `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`,
# `HOME` and `PWD` are also read, as location anchors only, and `PATH` is read by
# `hr_path_with_fallbacks` alone — as that function's input, which it prints back
# transformed and never assigns. `GITHUB_RUN_ID`, `GITHUB_SERVER_URL`,
# `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` and `HARNESS_INPUT_CHAIN` are read by
# `hr_remote_status_write` alone, as provenance values copied into
# `status.json` — never a configured value and never policy.
#
# CONFIGURATION IS READ AT RUN TIME, NOT FROZEN AT GENERATION TIME. That is the
# whole reason the shipped scripts carry no `{{token}}`: a guard whose protected
# set was substituted into a file when `init` ran enforces the wrong set the
# moment `protectedBranches` changes, and the failure is silent.
#
# THE THREE-STATE ANSWER — the reason this library exists.
# `hr_branch_is_protected` returns:
#
#     0  protected      — the branch matched a pattern in the resolved set
#     1  not protected  — the set was resolved and the branch is not in it
#     2  unresolvable   — the configuration could not be resolved at all
#                         (no `harness.config.json`, an unreadable one, absent
#                         or pre-1.5 `jq`, invalid JSON, more than one JSON
#                         document, or the required `defaultBranch` missing)
#
# A CONSUMER THAT TREATS 2 AS 1 TAKES A MUTATING ACTION ON A CONFIGURATION IT
# COULD NOT READ. Every caller therefore has a closed outcome for 2 and states
# it in its own header: the commit wrapper refuses loudly (non-zero), the push
# wrapper refuses visibly but non-fatally (exit 0 with a message, because its
# never-abort-the-caller contract is load-bearing), the watcher logs and defers.
#
# THE SAME THREE STATES REACH EVERY TYPED READER: `hr_state_dir`,
# `hr_command`, `hr_project_name` and the rest print their value and return 0,
# return 1 when the key is simply not set (and has no schema default to apply),
# and return 2 when the configuration could not be read. A caller must be able
# to tell "the key is empty" from "the file could not be read", because the
# first is an ordinary project and the second is a repository this script has no
# business acting in. `hr_phase_enabled` answers through the same three
# statuses and prints nothing: 0 is `true`, 1 is `false` or unset, and 2 also
# covers an unknown phase name or a non-boolean value. A reader that wants the
# finer distinction between "no `harness.config.json` at all" and "one that would not parse" calls
# `hr_config_load` directly, which returns 1 for the first and 2 for the second.
#
# THE PROTECTED SET. It is *(`protectedBranches` if present, else that key's
# schema default)* ∪ *{`defaultBranch`}*, matched as `case` globs so one
# `release/*` entry covers its namespace. `defaultBranch` is a required key, so
# its absence is an unresolvable configuration rather than a defaultable one; a
# `protectedBranches` present but EMPTY is a configured set, so it yields
# `{defaultBranch}` and not the schema default. There is no built-in matcher: a
# repository whose default branch is `trunk` and whose list is
# `["trunk","release/*"]` has every other name as an ordinary branch, and this
# library says so.
#
# THE ONE BRANCH NAME IN THIS FILE IS `protectedBranches`'s SCHEMA DEFAULT, and
# it is not the hardcoding the rule above is about. It is spelled exactly once,
# in `hr_protected_default_var`, mirroring `schemas/harness.config.schema.json`
# and the same default the CLI applies when it generates the committed pre-push
# hook — so for one configuration the hook and this library RESOLVE the same
# set. They can still ENFORCE different sets, because they differ in when they
# resolve it: this library re-reads `harness.config.json` on every call, while
# the hook is written create-if-absent and carries the set substituted into its
# `case` label when `init` wrote it. An edit to `protectedBranches` therefore
# binds a wrapper at once and binds the hook only after `init --force`, or
# after deleting the hook and re-running `init`. A third run re-renders the
# hook as a CONSEQUENCE rather than as a way to change the set: `init
# --reset-config` rebuilds `harness.config.json` itself, and re-renders the
# hook from the rebuilt file when the `case` label the hook carried no longer
# matches the set that file resolves — after a `.bak`, and never when the label
# cannot be read. It is not a route to reach for deliberately: the rebuild
# takes the whole config from detection and the flags, so every value that was
# set by hand in the file it replaces goes with it. Which resolution is
# authoritative follows the caller: a push is judged by the `case` label in the
# hook file, because git runs that file, and a wrapper is judged by what this
# library returns. The default is only ever UNIONED with the configured set,
# never a replacement for it, so it can widen the refusal and can never narrow
# one. The defect it must never become is a `case` list of remembered names
# that replaces what the adopter configured: that leaves a repository whose
# integration branch is named anything else with no protection at all, which is
# a wrapper committing or pushing where it should have refused. `init` writes
# `protectedBranches` on every adoption, so this default is reached only by a
# configuration somebody hand-edited the key out of.
#
# FILE DISCIPLINE. Sourced, never executed (mode 0644; the shebang above is a
# dialect marker for editors and linters). No `set -e` and no `set -u` — a
# sourced library must not change its caller's shell — but every parameter
# expansion here is defaulted, so it is safe to source into a caller that sets
# both. No top-level side effects, no exiting, no writes outside the fences of
# the write exceptions named above, and no diagnostics on stdout OR stderr:
# every reader is silent on failure and signals through its return status,
# because callers capture stdout. The one pass-through is the registry's two
# writers, `hr_registry_init` and `hr_registry_set`, which leave the shell's,
# `mktemp`'s and `jq`'s own stderr on a failed write to the caller, as the
# watcher's bodies they replaced did — that stream is the watcher's log — and
# add one line of their own, naming the lock, when `hr_registry_set` cannot
# take the registry lock. The artifact placement's three writers likewise leave
# `mkdir`'s, `cp`'s, `git add`'s and both wrappers' own output on their stdout
# and stderr for the caller to redirect into its log.
# That silence is why the lane reports a lock it BROKE through a
# variable instead of a log line — the caller owns the log.
#
# NAMING. Every function is prefixed `hr_`; every variable this file touches
# outside a `local` is prefixed `HR_`. The `HR_`-prefixed ones exist to return a
# value WITHOUT a command substitution — a `$(…)` forks a subshell, and the
# watcher calls these on every tick: `HR_CFG_PID`, `HR_CFG_ROOT`,
# `HR_CFG_STATE`, `HR_CFG_FILE`, `HR_CFG_SCALARS`, `HR_CFG_LISTS`,
# `HR_CFG_VALUE`, `HR_CFG_COMMAND_KEYS`, `HR_PROTECTED_DEFAULT`,
# `HR_INBOX_KIND`, `HR_INBOX_BRANCH`, the branch derivation's
# `HR_BRANCH_SLUG_MAX`, `HR_BRANCH_SUFFIX_MAX`, `HR_TAKEN_REMOTE`,
# `HR_TAKEN_ARTIFACTS` and `HR_TAKEN_WHY`, and the lane's
# `HR_LANE_RANK`, `HR_LANE_STATE`, `HR_LANE_RESUME_AT`, `HR_LANE_OBSERVED_AT`,
# `HR_LANE_OBSERVED_REPO`, `HR_LANE_OWNER_SLUG`, `HR_LANE_OWNER_PID`,
# `HR_LANE_OWNER_AT` and `HR_LANE_BROKEN_OWNER`, and the remote state bundle's
# names, which `hr_remote_names_var` assigns, with `HR_REMOTE_PLANNING_PATHS`
# (`hr_remote_planning_paths`) and `HR_REMOTE_PLANNING_PLACED` /
# `HR_REMOTE_PLANNING_KEPT` (`hr_remote_bundle_restore`) and `HR_REMOTE_ASIDE`
# (`hr_remote_move_aside`). Every one of them is assigned
# before it is read by the function that owns it, so an inherited value from a
# parent process is overwritten rather than believed.
#
# BASH 3.2 IS THE FLOOR. macOS ships `/bin/bash` 3.2, so nothing here uses an
# associative array, `${var^^}` / `${var,,}`, `mapfile` or `local -n`. The cache
# below is a string-record store for exactly that reason, and the one
# case-folding step forks `tr` rather than reaching for a 4.x expansion.
#
# JQ 1.5 IS THE FLOOR, AND AN OLDER `jq` IS UNRESOLVABLE, NOT ABSENT.
# `hr_config_load`'s program uses five constructs that are all jq 1.5 additions:
# `input` / `inputs` (the multi-document refusal), `@tsv` (the record format),
# `try … catch`, `error("…")` and the `def s($k; $v)` value-parameter form. On an
# older `jq` the program is a COMPILE error, so the load fails and every reader
# returns 2 — the closed path — while `command -v jq` still succeeds and says
# nothing. That is why `doctor` checks the version rather than the binary. If
# you add a construct here, check it against 1.5 or raise this floor in both
# places.
#
# THE CACHE IS PER PROCESS, SO A LONG-LIVED CALLER MUST RESET IT PER TICK.
# `hr_config_load` runs ONE `jq` and holds the result in shell variables, so a
# script that reads a dozen keys forks `jq` once instead of a dozen times. The
# entry is keyed by root and stamped with `$$`, never by the file's contents:
# a caller that outlives an edit to `harness.config.json` — the watcher, which
# runs for days — is answered from the document it replaced until it calls
# `hr_config_reset`. THE WATCHER CALLS IT ONCE AT THE TOP OF EVERY TICK; a
# one-shot wrapper never needs to. A `$(…)` runs in a SUBSHELL, which inherits
# the cache but cannot write one back, so a caller that reads only through
# command substitutions loads the document once per read: call
# `hr_config_load "$root" || :` once, unsubstituted, to warm it. Forgetting that
# line is slower and still correct.

#                        which is how `jq`, a Homebrew toolchain and an agent CLI
#                        under `~/.local/bin` stay resolvable from a bare
#                        service-manager PATH, none of them being in `/usr/bin`.
#                        A Homebrew copy of a name `/usr/bin` DOES hold (`ruby`,
#                        `python3`, `curl`, `git`) is reached but no longer
#                        preferred, which is the price of never demoting the

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The PATH policy — the one function here that runs BEFORE anything else works.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Print — never export, never assign — a `PATH` that keeps everything the caller
# inherited and adds the usual locations it is missing. Takes no arguments,
# reads `PATH` and `HOME` from the environment, always returns 0.
#
# IT APPENDS; IT NEVER PROMOTES AND NEVER DEMOTES. Each fallback directory is
# added to a SUFFIX only when it is absent from the inherited `PATH`, and the
# suffix goes AFTER the inherited value. A directory already there keeps its
# inherited position and is never re-added, and the relative order of everything
# the caller inherited is unchanged — whatever the caller put first stays first.
# Prepending, even prepending only what is absent, inserts a directory ahead of a
# version-manager shims directory the caller deliberately put first, and the tool
# that then resolves is the system one.
#
# IT NAMES NO TOOLCHAIN. The list is locations, not languages: which toolchain a
# repository needs is its own configuration's business.
#
# BUILTIN-ONLY, AND THAT IS THE CONTRACT, NOT AN OPTIMIZATION. The caller runs
# this to MAKE `PATH` usable, so every step is a `case`, a parameter expansion or
# `printf` — an external command here would be the failure this function exists
# to prevent.
#
# NO EMPTY ENTRY SURVIVES. An empty `PATH` element means the current directory,
# and callers of this are daemons, so a leading, trailing or doubled colon in the
# inherited value is dropped (order and duplicates otherwise untouched). With an
# unset or empty `PATH` the result is the fallback list alone; with an unset or
# empty `HOME` the `$HOME/.local/bin` entry is skipped rather than rendered as a
# bare `/.local/bin`.

# Judge whether <path> resolves STRICTLY INSIDE `<root>/<state_dir>/scratch/`.

#
# Two callers, differing only in what they do with an accepted path:
# `scratch-run.sh` executes a file there and `remote-run.sh discard` removes a
# directory there. So this reports a keyword in `HR_SCRATCH_WHY` and leaves every
# message and exit code to its caller.
#
# The rule, stated once:
#   - `..` is refused ANYWHERE in the argument, not only as a whole segment —
#     strictly stronger, and free, because nothing in that directory depends on
#     a file's name. Then any character outside `A-Za-z0-9._/-` is refused. Both
#     tests run on <path> as the caller received it, before anything resolves.
#   - A relative <path> resolves against <base> when given, else <root>; an
#     absolute one is taken as given.
#   - Both sides of the comparison are resolved PHYSICALLY (`cd … && pwd -P`), so
#     a symlinked directory planted inside the scratch tree cannot widen the
#     fence. The target's parent must be the scratch directory or beneath it, and
#     a basename of `.` (the scratch directory itself) is refused.
#   - A target that is itself a symlink is refused rather than followed: its
#     destination is outside this judgement. The target need not exist.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE RUN REGISTRY.
#
# THE CONTRACT IS NOT THIS SECTION'S. The registry's JSON shape
# (`{"runs": {"<branch>": {…}}}`), its field set and its status vocabulary are
# stated in `autonomous-watcher.sh`'s header and registry comment block; this
# section only reads and writes that shape, for every script that shares the
# file, so no second copy of a writer exists.
#
# Each function takes the registry file as its first argument — the caller
# resolves it as `hr_state_path <root> autonomous_logs/registry.json` — and is
# write exception 2 in the header. Every value is written as a JSON string;
# every write stamps `branch` and `updated_at` on the record. No shell option is
# assumed: the caller may set `-e`, `-u` or neither.
#
# EVERY WRITE IS A LOCKED READ-MODIFY-WRITE. Every script sharing the file
# writes it, and so does the watcher's own `( … ) &` engine subshell, so two
# unserialized writers each read the same record and the second `mv` silently
# drops the first one's key. The lock is a `mkdir` of `<file>.lock` holding an
# `owner` file with a per-call token — the `mktemp` name of that call's temp
# file, because `$$` inside a subshell is the parent's pid and bash 3.2 has no
# per-subshell pid variable — and only a call whose token is still in `owner`
# releases it.
#
# STALENESS IS THE LOCK DIRECTORY'S AGE, NEVER A PID. The stall watchdog kills
# the engine subshell mid-write, so a dead holder is expected, and a pid says
# nothing about a lock the killed subshell took under its parent's `$$`. A write
# is one `jq` over a file of a few records, well under a second, so a lock 10 s
# old is a crashed holder; a waiter polls every 0.05 s for up to 12 s — past the
# stale age, so a waiter that arrives just after a crash breaks the lock rather
# than giving up. Both are constants here, not environment values: the header
# allows policy-carrying environment values for the lane only.
#
# BREAKERS ARE SERIALIZED, AND NONE RENAMES A LIVE LOCK. A waiter that judges
# the lock stale takes a second `mkdir` mutex, `<file>.lock.break`, judges the
# lock's age again under it, and only then renames the lock aside and empties
# it, as `hr_lane_acquire` does. A lock re-taken since the first judgement is
# fresh, so the second leaves it alone. Between the second judgement and the
# rename, nothing but a breaker or the lock's own holder frees the path:
# breakers are serialized, and the holder of a lock that old is dead by the
# stale rule. The watchdog can kill a breaker inside the mutex, so a mutex 10 s
# old is removed by the next waiter. That removal is the one window left open.
# Two waiters that judge one abandoned mutex old together can both remove it,
# and the second can remove the fresh mutex the first has just taken. Two
# breakers then judge the lock at once, so reaching it takes a breaker killed
# inside the mutex, a stale lock and three concurrent writers.
#
# A write that cannot take the lock prints one stderr line naming it, writes
# nothing and returns 1.
#
# ONE CALL, SEVERAL KEYS. `hr_registry_set <file> <branch> <key> <value> [<key>
# <value> …]` writes every pair in one `jq` pass under one lock and one `mv`.
# A caller writing two keys that a concurrent reader must never see apart — a
# status and the reason for it — MUST pass them in one call.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DERIVING A BRANCH NAME FROM A TITLE.
#
# THE RULE. A title becomes a branch name by a fixed fold, with no model and no
# confirmation step: lowercase A–Z, turn every run of characters outside
# `[a-z0-9]` into one `_`, trim `_` from both ends, cut to `HR_BRANCH_SLUG_MAX`
# and trim a trailing `_` the cut exposed. An empty result takes the caller's
# <fallback> (`issue_<number>` for an issue, `task_<run id>` for a dispatch). A
# taken name takes the lowest free `<name>_<n>`, `_2` through
# `HR_BRANCH_SUFFIX_MAX`; the first branch carries no suffix (`Version bump` →
# `version_bump`), and `_2` reads as "the second".
#
# - The fold is ASCII-only under `LC_ALL=C`, so `é` is a separator, never a
#   letter — `hr_repo_slug`'s precedent. A locale-dependent fold would derive
#   different names on different runners; a lowercase ASCII name passes every
#   `git check-ref-format` rule and cannot collide by case on macOS or Windows.
# - The cap is 60, cut before the suffix. The name becomes a working-copy
#   directory component (`<projectName>-<branch>`) and prefixes artifact names
#   (`<branch>_task_prompt.md`); 60 keeps each far under a 255-byte file-name
#   limit and readable in the Actions run list. GitHub documents no ref limit.
#
# THIS SECTION ONLY READS. It fetches nothing and creates no branch or file; a
# caller that wants `origin` fresh fetches first. Given a <gh_cli>, it also asks
# GitHub one read per candidate — the run workflow's runs under that name — and
# still writes nothing. A registry is read only when it already exists, because
# `hr_registry_get` creates an absent one.

# The walker state loses its dot because `actions/upload-artifact` skips hidden
# files by default. THE BUNDLE ITSELF IS NEVER COMMITTED. Every file outside
# `planning/` is gitignored machine-local state, and the remote-status and
# move-aside paths sit under `autonomous_logs/`, whose ignore rule already
# covers them. The files under `planning/` are untracked drafts that the flow
# commits itself at its P1/P3 convergence; the bundle only carries them.
#
# THE PLANNING PATHS ARE A MIRROR of the contracts that write and stage them:
# `plugin/instructions/task_plan_writing_instructions_autonomous.md` →
# `## Override 3` and `## Override 4` staging lists, and
# `<scripts_dir>/flows/task_plan_writing.graph.json` → each node's `findingsFolder`. A path
# added there is an edit to `hr_remote_planning_paths`. Only planning is
# carried because the walker's one graph is `task_plan_writing.graph.json`;
# implementation-phase per-unit review folders never span a pause, which waits
# for a clean tracked tree. `HR_REMOTE_STATE_SCHEMA` stays `'1'`: `planning/`
# is additive, an older reader ignores it, and a newer reader of an older
# bundle finds none.
#
# WHO READS EACH FILE. `status.json`: `remote-run.sh sync` / `status` (into the
# local registry), `continue` / `poll` (the decision, `chain`, the reset time)
# and the next job's seed. The clarification directory and `PAUSE_PROGRESS.md`:
# the next job, and the user's local mirror. The walker state: the next job
# only. `planning/`: the next job only, never a mirror — an untracked draft left
# in the mirror would make its later fast-forward to `origin/<branch>` refuse,
# because the draft's own convergence commit adds the same path. `run.log`: the
# user only — `sync` copies it to the main checkout's logs directory itself,
# and no restore places it.
#
# `status.json` — schema `HR_REMOTE_STATE_SCHEMA`; every value a JSON string:
#   schema                  a reader that does not recognise it treats the bundle as absent
#   branch, engine          the run's branch; `task` | `user_review` | `docs`
#   status                  `running` | `parked` | `park_loop` | `paused` | `completed` | `failed`
#   pause_reason            `usage` | `budget` | `user` | `overload` | empty. The registry's
#                           registry-only `killed` and `expired` are never written
#                           here: `sync` derives each from a run and its artifact
#                           list, not from a bundle
#   usage_resume_at         the epoch second a usage pause may resume at, or empty
#   park_loop_cycles, resume_max_question_index, auto_resumes, stall_restarts
#                           the counters that must survive a job boundary
#   chain                   the writing job's OWN input `HARNESS_INPUT_CHAIN`, never
#                           a value carried from an earlier bundle
#   control_polled_at       the lower bound of the next control poll, or empty
#   decision                `continue` | `wait-poller` | `stop`

# THE MACHINE-LEVEL USAGE LANE.
#
# WHAT IT EXISTS TO STOP. The rate-limit window these runs consume belongs to the
# ACCOUNT, while every pause and resume decision is made from per-repository
# files. Two daemons on one machine therefore each compute a resume time as if
# they were the sole consumer: repository A pauses, repository B keeps spending
# the shared window, A's resume time arrives already stale, A wakes, re-hits its
# own gate and re-pauses. The published record carries the one fact a repository
# cannot see for itself: what the rest of the machine has already observed of the
# shared window. The advisory lock is the separate, opt-in half — it serializes
# which repository on this machine starts.
#
# TWO HALVES, AND NEITHER LIMIT IS DERIVABLE FROM THE OTHER. The record
# COORDINATES and is on by default (`USAGE_LANE_STATE_ENABLED`, `1`); by itself
# it defers nobody. The lock SERIALIZES which repository starts, and is opt-in
# and off by default (`USAGE_LANE_LOCK_ENABLED`, `0`). The per-repository cap
# bounds HOW MANY runs one repository has in flight: a repository holding the
# lock still obeys its own cap, and one that cannot take it starts nothing
# however much of its own capacity is free. Both knobs belong to the WATCHER —
# this library reads neither, and reads no environment variable in place of a
# configured value.
#
# TWO ARTIFACTS, BOTH UNDER `hr_lane_dir` (created 0700, outside every
# repository):
#
#   usage-state.json  the worst assessment any watcher has published:
#                     {"schema":1,"state":"allowed|warning|overage|rejected|unknown",
#                      "resume_at":<epoch>,"observed_at":<epoch>,
#                      "observed_by":{"repo":"<slug>","branch":"<branch>"}}
#                     Written atomically — a temp file in the same directory plus
#                     a rename — so a reader sees the old record or the new one
#                     and never a half-written line.
#   run-lane.lock     a DIRECTORY holding one `owner` file whose single line is
#                     `<slug> <pid> <acquired_at>`.
#
# THE LOCK IS A DIRECTORY BECAUSE `mkdir` IS THE ATOMIC PRIMITIVE AVAILABLE HERE.
# `flock(1)` is a util-linux program and is absent on macOS; the shell's own
# `set -o noclobber` redirection is defeated by an inherited `-C`. `mkdir` fails
# when the name exists, on both supported platforms and on bash 3.2, which is the
# whole test-and-set this needs.
#
# MERGED WORST-WINS, AND "WORSE" IS (STATE, THEN RESUME TIME). A publisher
# replaces the stored record when its own state ranks higher, when the state
# ranks the SAME and its resume time is later (the same state binding for longer
# is the worse fact for every consumer), or when the stored record is SPENT — its
# `resume_at` has passed, or it reported no resume time at all and has aged past
# `HR_LANE_STATE_MAX_AGE_SECS`. Without that last clause a record that named no
# reset would pin the file for the life of the machine.
#
# FAIL OPEN ON THE STATE, CLOSED ON THE LANE. An absent, unreadable or
# unparsable `usage-state.json` reads as `unknown 0`, which defers nobody:
# pausing on an unreadable file would put a machine-level fault in charge of run
# state, and each repository's own gate is what pauses its runs. A lock directory
# that cannot be read or created is NOT assumed free: `hr_lane_acquire` returns
# non-zero, and the caller defers exactly as it defers for its own cap. The
# closed half is reached only when the caller has enabled the lock.
#
# THE STALE-BREAKER, AND WHY IT REPORTS THROUGH A VARIABLE. A lock is broken and
# re-taken when its owning pid no longer exists AND its record has aged past
# `HR_LANE_LOCK_STALE_SECS`, or — whatever that pid says — when the record has
# aged past `HR_LANE_LOCK_MAX_AGE_SECS`. NEITHER SIGNAL IS SUFFICIENT ON ITS
# OWN. A dead pid does not mean an idle machine: a one-shot pass takes the lane,
# starts a run that outlives it and exits, so its pid is gone within the second
# while its run is still going — breaking on that alone would put two
# repositories on the machine every time. A live pid does not mean a live
# holder either, since a pid is recycled. Breaking renames the directory aside
# before removing it, so a competing breaker that has already re-created the
# lock cannot have its fresh `owner` deleted by this one — and, for the same
# reason, a lock too young to be stale is held even when its `owner` file has
# not been written yet. The previous owner is reported in
# `HR_LANE_BROKEN_OWNER` for the caller to log, because this file prints nothing.
#
# THE THREE CEILINGS ARE THE ONLY ENVIRONMENT VALUES THAT CARRY POLICY HERE. The
# file's other environment reads are location anchors, not policy:
# `XDG_STATE_HOME` and `HOME` in `hr_lane_dir`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `HOME` in
# `hr_machine_config_dir`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME` and `HOME` in `hr_cache_dir`, `PWD` in `hr_repo_root` and `hr_main_repo`. The
# ceilings are machine-scoped policy with no configuration key:
#
#   HR_LANE_STATE_MAX_AGE_SECS   21600  when a PUBLISHED RECORD THAT NAMED NO
#                                       reset time stops holding the merge — one
#                                       5-hour window plus slack. Applied only to
#                                       such a record, so a legitimately long
#                                       weekly window is never aged out from
#                                       under its own `resume_at`.
#   HR_LANE_LOCK_STALE_SECS        900  how long a lock whose owner pid is GONE
#                                       is still honored — long enough to cover a
#                                       holder that runs as a series of one-shot
#                                       passes rather than as a daemon, short
#                                       enough that a crashed holder frees the
#                                       machine in minutes.
#   HR_LANE_LOCK_MAX_AGE_SECS    86400  when a lock is broken regardless of its
#                                       pid — far longer than any single run,
#                                       since a holder releases the lane as soon
#                                       as it has nothing live.
