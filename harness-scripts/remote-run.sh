#        review, a protected branch, a review file that is not a readable
#        regular file, or a branch its settledness test reads as not settled
#        (its paragraph); for sync, the

#        status, a local record that does not carry `execution:
#        github-actions`, or no record and `execution.target` not

#        downloaded bundle is unrecognised (sync, restore, and status with no
#        local record); the inputs payload is over the limit; a named answer
#        file is missing (a relative --answers-from resolves against the
#        caller's directory). For restore under --resume answer, "nothing more":
#        no previous bundle of the branch's current lineage, the previous
#        bundle expired (the message names
#        its expiry and the resume command), `HARNESS_INPUT_ANSWERS` not an object of
#        positive-integer keys to strings, or an answer whose `question_<n>.md`
#        is not at the top level of the previous bundle — nothing is restored
#        and no answer is written. For discard, <dir> does not resolve
#        strictly inside `<state_dir>/scratch/`, is a symlink, or exists and
#        is not a directory; nothing removed
#     3  gh failed: not found, or a non-zero exit — the first line of gh's
#        stderr is named. For poll: the listing or the disable failed. For
#        pause-requested and run-created-at, also an answer that is not the
#        expected JSON; a caller never pauses on a failed read. For start, the
#        dispatch failed AFTER the branch and its task prompt were pushed; for
#        review, the listing failed, or the dispatch failed AFTER the review
#        was pushed. For
#        list, the listing or `git ls-remote` failed; nothing written
#     4  start: placement failed — the branch cut, the copy, the commit or the
#        push — and nothing was dispatched; the working copy and the local
#        branch the cut created were removed. review: placement failed — the
#        copy (the branch checked out in another working copy included), the
#        fast-forward, the commit or the push — and nothing was dispatched; a
#        copy it cut was removed
#     5  pause-requested only: the read succeeded and found no such run
#
# `start` IS THE ADAPTERS' ONE ENTRY: every trigger (an issue event, a forge
# dispatch, anything later) reduces to a branch and a task text and ends here.
# In order, stopping at the first failure: refuse a protected branch (2); refuse
# a prompt file that is not a readable regular file (2); cut the branch from
# `origin/<defaultBranch>` with `create-worktree.sh --no-bootstrap`; place the
# file at `<state_dir>/task_prompts/<branch>_task_prompt.md` in that working
# copy (the state directory resolved there, never in the main checkout), commit
# it as `chore: add task prompt for <branch>` and confirm `origin/<branch>`
# equals `HEAD` (each failure 4); then remove the working copy and the local
# branch it created — on every exit after the cut, success included and
# wherever `start` runs, because nothing reads the copy once the push has landed
# and a leftover branch makes the next cut of that name refuse; a copy or branch
# that existed before the cut is never removed — and `dispatch --engine task
# --resume none --chain 0`, composed by `verb_dispatch` itself. The placement is the library's
# (`hr_task_prompt_rel`, `hr_place_artifact`, `hr_commit_placed`,
# `hr_push_landed`), the same calls the watcher's inbox pass makes, so nothing
# downstream can tell where a task came from. It writes no registry record: a
# trigger job has no registry, and such a run needs no local record: the local
# commands act on it through GitHub.
#
# `fetch` IS THE COMMANDS' READ OF ONE BRANCH ON GITHUB, needing no local
# record. Gated like a sending verb. <out_dir> must be an existing, empty
# directory. It reads the newest `harness run <branch>` run through the same
# derivation `sync` makes (`remote_state`), downloads that run's state bundle
# into <out_dir> when one applies, and prints these lines, each always present
# and empty when unknown — the key names are a wire the commands parse:
#   run_id:  run_url:  run_status:   the newest `harness run <branch>` run
#   state:           `none` when no such run is listed, else the derivation's
#   pause_reason:  engine:  detail:   from the derivation
#   open_questions:  space-separated <n> of every top-level
#                    `<out_dir>/clarifications/<branch>/question_<n>.md` with
#                    no `answer_<n>.md` beside it, ascending
#   bundle_dir:      <out_dir> when a bundle was downloaded
#
# `discard` REMOVES THE DIRECTORY A COMMAND FETCHED INTO, so the command needs
# no recursive `rm` of its own. It removes <dir> only when the library's
# `hr_scratch_path_var` accepts it: strictly inside the checkout's
# `<state_dir>/scratch/`, not a symlink, and a directory when it exists
# (2 otherwise). A relative <dir>
# resolves against the caller's directory; the root is `--repo`, or else
# `hr_repo_root` of the working directory, as for `restore`. No `gh` call and
# no `execution.target` gate. A <dir> that does not exist is exit 0. It
# creates nothing and writes nothing else.
#
# `review` PLACES A USER REVIEW ROUND ON THE BRANCH TIP AND DISPATCHES IT, for
# `/autonomous-sdlc-harness:branch-user-review` on a run that executes on
# GitHub. In order, stopping at the first failure: refuse a protected branch
# and a review file that is not a readable regular file (2; a relative
# --review-file resolves against the caller's directory); refuse a branch that
# `branch_settled_var`, the settledness test `control` and `collect` share, reads as not
# settled (2). Its newest `harness run <branch>` run decides: none listed is
# settled only under --allow-no-run; a `completed` one is read by
# `remote_state`; any other is in flight as `running` until its `RUN_JOB_NAME`
# job has completed, and then read by `remote_state` as a finished run. Settled
# is `completed` or `failed`; `running`, `parked`, `park_loop` and `paused` are
# refused, an expired bundle naming its expiry. The refusal stays for this
# verb because a local round's file exists only on the caller's machine, so no
# later collection could pick it up. The bundle it reads is
# downloaded to `sync`'s directory, the one write a refusal makes. The copy: the main
# checkout's remote record's mirror when its `worktree` exists and is on the
# branch, never removed; otherwise `create-worktree.sh --existing
# --no-bootstrap` into `hr_worktree_dir`, removed with the local branch it
# DWIM-created on every exit, as `start` removes its cut. Either copy is
# fast-forwarded to `origin/<branch>`. No bootstrap runs: the copy holds one
# placed file. The round comes from `git ls-tree` of the copy's `HEAD` under
# `<state_dir>/user_reviews/` — the engine's own round source: each basename
# matching `^(.+)_review(_[0-9]+)?\.md$` whose captured branch EQUALS <branch>,
# the unsuffixed file being round 1; next is `<branch>_review.md` when none
# matched, else `<branch>_review_<max+1>.md`. It is placed, committed as
# `hr_user_review_subject`'s `chore: add user review for <branch>` and pushed
# (each failure 4); the cut copy is removed; then `dispatch --engine
# user_review --resume none --chain 0`, after which it holds until a `harness run
# <branch>` run whose `headSha` is the pushed commit is listed — `run_by_sha_var`,
# `trigger`'s bounded lookup — so a review job serialized behind it never reads
# the branch as settled before GitHub lists the new run; a lookup that runs out
# is one `::warning::` line and still exit 0. A remote record, when one exists, is
# set `running` / `user_review` in one write after the dispatch. Then the round
# is reported as `report round`. Under --reviewers (comma-separated logins) the
# note is `Round <round> from pull request #<pr> by @<a>, @<b>`, <pr> read from
# --source's `/pull/<n>` or else the branch's open pull request, with ` (<source>)`
# after it under --source. Otherwise it is `Round <round>`, plus ` from <source>`
# under --source, and ` by @<actor>` under --actor (a login, as for `stop`),
# else ` from a local session`.
# --allow-no-run EXISTS FOR A LOCALLY EXECUTED BRANCH REVIEWED ON GITHUB: such
# a branch has no `harness run <branch>` run, and its round runs through
# `WORKFLOW_RUN_FILE` because a GitHub-started round always does. Its local
# record carries no `execution: github-actions`, so it is neither read as the
# copy nor written; the round runs remotely, and the branch's local working
# copy falls behind `origin/<branch>` until the maintainer fast-forwards it.
# The flag widens only the none-listed refusal.
#
# `trigger` IS THE GITHUB EVENT ADAPTER, the one step of the trigger
# workflow's job: event -> (branch, task text) -> `start`. It handles
# `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME` `issues` and `repository_dispatch`; any other name, or an
# event file it cannot read, exits 1. Like `restore` it acts on `hr_repo_root` of the working
# directory, and it takes no part in the sending-verb gate: it gates itself, so
# a refusal can still be commented. It reads, only from the environment:
#   GITHUB_EVENT_NAME, GITHUB_EVENT_PATH   the event; each field is read by `jq`
#                        into a variable and is only ever an argument or file
#                        bytes, never shell source; `.repository.owner.login`
#                        and `.repository.owner.type` only when
#                        `HARNESS_RUN_ACTORS` is unset
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY, GITHUB_SERVER_URL, GITHUB_RUN_ID   the `gh` target and
#                        the URLs its comments name
#   HARNESS_REMOTE_STOP  non-empty: every start is refused
#   HARNESS_TRIGGER_LABEL   the trigger label; when empty, `DEFAULT_TRIGGER_LABEL`
#                        or `LEGACY_TRIGGER_LABEL`, per the paragraph below
#   HARNESS_TRIGGER_ALLOWED_BOTS   comma-separated bot logins allowed to start
#   HARNESS_RUN_ACTORS   comma-separated people allowed to act on a run, `*`
#                        for every writer; unset admits a `User` owner alone
#                        (`run_actor_listed`)
#   HARNESS_TRIGGER_LOOKUP_SECS    seconds between run lookups; `5` when empty.
#                        A test seam
#   RUNNER_TEMP          where the prompt snapshot is written; a `mktemp -d`
#                        directory when empty
# THE LEGACY LABEL. The workflow `init` now writes always passes a non-empty
# `HARNESS_TRIGGER_LABEL`; only the previous release's workflow, which
# `init --upgrade-workflows` never re-renders, passes it empty, and its `if:`
# already ran the job for `LEGACY_TRIGGER_LABEL`. So when it is empty either
# `DEFAULT_TRIGGER_LABEL` or `LEGACY_TRIGGER_LABEL` is accepted, and the comment
# and the label removal name the one applied; a new workflow starts on
# `LEGACY_TRIGGER_LABEL` only when the variable names it.
# An `action` other than `labeled`, or another label, is one line and exit 0
# with no `gh` call. Otherwise refused, in this order, each refusal one issue
# comment naming the reason and the way on:
#   1. `HARNESS_REMOTE_STOP` is set
#   2. `hr_forge` is not `github` or `hr_execution_target` is not
#      `github-actions` — before any authorisation, so a disabled trigger asks
#      GitHub nothing about the labeller
#   3. the issue is not `open`
#   4. `sender.login` is `ghost` (GitHub's placeholder for a deleted account),
#      empty, or not a login shape (`^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9-]*$`, plus `[bot]`
#      for a `Bot`)
#   5. `sender.type` is not `User` and the login is not an exact entry of
#      `HARNESS_TRIGGER_ALLOWED_BOTS` — checked by the listing alone, with no
#      permission call, because the permission API answers `none` or 404 for a bot
#   6. a `User` whose `collaborators/<login>/permission` is not `admin` or
#      `write` — `maintain` reads as `write` and `triage` as `read` there; a
#      failed call is "could not confirm write access", never a pass
#   7. a writer `HARNESS_RUN_ACTORS` does not admit — after refusal 6, so a
#      non-writer is still told about write access
# Refusals 4 to 7 are `authorise_actor`, the one actor check `control` reuses.
# Before them, after refusal 2, a re-run (GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT above 1) whose
# GITHUB_TRIGGERING_ACTOR is not `github-actions[bot]` and is not admitted by
# `HARNESS_RUN_ACTORS` is refused (`rerun_actor_listed`), on both event kinds:
# a re-run replays the event, so its sender is whoever first acted.
# Then it fetches `origin <defaultBranch>` (a failure tolerated), derives the
# branch with `hr_derive_branch <title> issue_<number>`, passing `gh` so a name
# with run-workflow history counts as taken (2 or 3 refused), writes
# the snapshot — `# <title>`, the body's bytes, `---` and a provenance sentence
# naming the issue, the labeller, the label and the time — and runs `start` as a
# child. After a start it looks up the `harness run <branch>` run whose
# `headSha` is the `origin/<branch>` commit `start` pushed, at most
# `TRIGGER_RUN_LOOKUP_TRIES` times, falling back to the branch's filtered run
# list, and comments the branch and that URL; the comment never names an older
# run of the branch. Every comment ends with the marker
# `<!-- sdlc-harness event=started branch=<branch> -->` on a start and
# `event=refused` otherwise (`branch=` empty before one is derived), and is
# followed by removing the label, so re-applying it is deliberate; then a start
# sets the state label `sdlc-harness: running`. That comment, that removal and
# that one label are the trigger's only writes to the issue; a refusal sets no
# label. A removal or a label set that fails is one `::warning::` line.
# A `repository_dispatch` reads `.action` (where GitHub puts the `event_type`)
# and `client_payload`'s `title`, `body` and `source`, the contract being
#   {"event_type": TRIGGER_DISPATCH_EVENT_TYPE, "client_payload": {"title": …,
#    "body": …, "source": …}}
# within GitHub's `client_payload` limits: at most 10 top-level properties and
# under 64 KB, so a longer task text does not fit. Another `.action` is one line
# and exit 0 with no `gh` call; an empty or missing `title` is refused. It has
# no labeller: GitHub sends one only for a fine-grained token with Contents
# write or a classic token with `repo`, so the token holder is the authority,
# and refusals 3 to 6 do not apply. After refusal 2 a `User` sender
# (`.sender.login`, `.sender.type`) that `HARNESS_RUN_ACTORS` does not admit is
# refused with no permission call, and so is a sender with no type unless the
# list is `*`, failing closed; any other sender type passes. The fallback name is `task_<GITHUB_RUN_ID>`
# and the snapshot's provenance sentence names the event type, `source` when
# set, and the time. There is no issue, so no comment and no label: every
# outcome is printed to stdout and appended as a Markdown block to
# `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` when that is set, an append failure one `::warning::`.
#     0  started (commented), or ignored
#     1  not an `issues` or `repository_dispatch` event, or the event could not
#        be read
#     2  refused (commented)
#     3  a `gh` step after the decision failed: the comment could not be posted
#        (an `::error::` line; issues only), or `start` pushed the branch but
#        its dispatch failed (commented with the manual Run-workflow way on)
#     4  `start` refused or failed its placement (commented)
#
# `report` TURNS A LIFECYCLE EVENT INTO ONE COMMENT AND ONE STATE LABEL, through
# the forge surface (its section states the functions). Job-side for its root,
# as `trigger` is, and outside the sending-verb gate: it does nothing, with one
# line, unless `hr_forge` is `github` and `hr_execution_target` is
# `github-actions`. The comment goes to the open same-repository pull request
# whose head is <branch> when origin's <branch> carries its task prompt or
# `<state_dir>/flow_progress/<branch>_progress.md` (`forge_recognised`), else to
# the issue named by the last `Started from <server>/<repo>/issues/<n> by @` line of its committed
# task prompt, else nowhere (`stop`'s `--pr` and `--branch-gone` change this
# for its own report: its paragraph). The label `STATE_LABEL_PREFIX<state>` replaces any
# other state label on that issue and that pull request, each when known; the
# label is a view, and the run list stays the authority. The state map:
# `parked` and `park_loop` -> parked, `paused` -> paused, `resumed` -> running,
# `failed` -> failed, `stopped` -> stopped, `round` (review's) -> running,
# `not_started` (collect's) -> paused or failed, as its caller says. A
# `not_started` comment says GitHub did not start the run's job, so nothing ran
# and the branch is unchanged, and names its way on: `COMMAND_HANDLE resume`
# when the state is paused and an engine was recovered, else the **Run
# workflow** form with that engine, or with the three to choose from.
# On a pull-request target that is not a draft, `round` runs `gh pr ready
# --undo` before its comment, with the caller's own token, and its comment says
# the pull request is a draft again until the round completes; a refusal (a
# plan without drafts) is one `::warning::` line naming gh's error, and the
# comment then says turning it back was refused and it stays ready for review
# while the round works. A `failed` comment on a pull request reads the
# registry record's `engine`: for
# `user_review` it names a review requesting changes and says the pull request
# stays open; otherwise it says the draft stays open, to close to discard the
# run, or, when an issue is known, to re-apply the trigger label there for a
# new run on the next indexed branch. A plain `stopped` on a pull request says
# its draft stays open and closing it discards the run. A `stopped` report also
# rewrites the progress comment of each pull request it labels, its
# `in progress` line becoming `stopped` (`forge_progress_stopped`). No other
# event changes a pull request's draft state.
# Every job event — `parked`, `park_loop`, `paused`, `resumed`, `round`,
# `failed` and `not_started` — posts nothing and sets no label when `remote_branch_stopped`,
# asked afresh, finds the branch stopped, so a job a stop overtook never
# overwrites `stopped`; a failed listing reports anyway, and `stopped` is never
# withheld. `completed` (deliver's) and `launched` (the trigger's
# own comment) are one line each, as is any other event. The comment names the
# next GitHub action — never a slash command — then <note> byte for byte, then
# this run's URL when `GITHUB_RUN_ID` is set, then the marker line
# `<!-- sdlc-harness event=<event> branch=<branch> -->`. The pause reason and
# reset come from the registry record, read only when the registry file exists.
# `parked` instead posts one comment per open question — `open_questions_in`
# over `$root`'s state directory, ascending — carrying `question_<n>.md` less
# every line naming its own `answer_<n>.md` (another index's line stays), cut
# at its last whole line within `QUESTION_COMMENT_MAX_BYTES` and then naming
# the file in the `STATE_ARTIFACT_NAME` artifact; then the answer form, the
# comment's one answer instruction: a comment whose first line is
# `COMMAND_HANDLE answer <n>` (`<n>` optional when one question is open) and
# whose following lines are the answer; then a fenced copy block of that form,
# `COMMAND_HANDLE answer <n>` over `<your answer>`; the marker adds
# `question=<n>`. With no question open it posts nothing, sets no label and
# prints one `::error::` line naming the branch. The label
# is set once per target, not per question. When the registry's `pause_reason`
# is `user` (a pause the job dropped and the run never honoured), `parked`
# appends `PAUSE_FOLDED_NOTE` to <note> and `park_loop` appends
# `PAUSE_FOLDED_HOLD_NOTE`, each after one blank line. On a public repository a
# question comment and its answer are public, as the artifact already is
# (`docs/remote-execution.md` -> `## 11. Security`, *What a reader of the
# repository's Actions runs can see*).
# `progress` (`forge_progress`) keeps ONE comment per run or round on the pull
# request, never on the issue, and sets no label. Gated in order, each stop one
# line: `forge_on`; `hr_progress_comments` (`execution.progressComments` false,
# or unreadable); `remote_branch_stopped`, as for the job events above; no task
# or user-review ledger at `$root`'s `<state_dir>/flow_progress/<branch>_progress.md`
# (`hr_ledger_phases` — a docs-engine ledger posts nothing); no open
# same-repository pull request that `forge_recognised` holds for. The body is
# *Progress of the harness run on `<branch>`:* or *Progress of user-review round
# <n> on `<branch>`:*, then `- <label>: done`, `in progress` (the first pending
# phase) or `not started` for `Planning`, `Implementation`, `Branch review`,
# `Done` (a round: `Fix plan`, `Fix implementation`, `Branch review`, `Done`) —
# plain list items, no timestamp, no run URL — then the marker
# `<!-- sdlc-harness event=progress branch=<branch> -->`, gaining ` round=<n>`
# for a round. One paginated comment listing picks the newest
# `github-actions[bot]` comment whose last non-empty line is that marker: none
# is one `forge_comment`; a body equal to the render (carriage returns and
# trailing newlines aside) is no call and one `already current` line; otherwise
# one `PATCH` of that comment — the only comment this file ever edits. A refused
# listing, create or edit is one `::warning::` line. After a stop,
# `forge_progress_stopped` edits that same comment, so it is still the only
# comment this file edits, and a resumed job's first progress pass renders it
# from the ledger again.
# It never fails its caller: every problem is one line and exit 0.
#
# `open` OPENS THE RUN'S DRAFT PULL REQUEST at the run's start, so its issue
# links it from the moment it exists. Job-side for its root and self-gated, as
# `deliver` is (`forge_on`, one line when off); it takes <branch> and no
# bundle. A pull-request lookup that fails is one `::warning::` line and opens
# nothing; an open same-repository pull request whose head is <branch> is one
# line, and none is opened. Otherwise `forge_open_pr` — the one opener, which
# `deliver` also calls — creates it against `defaultBranch` with `deliver`'s
# title, body, token and retry rules: a `--draft` create with
# `HARNESS_PR_TOKEN` as `GH_TOKEN` when set, no retry on `PR_CREATE_FORBIDDEN`,
# one retry without `--draft` on any other failure. Opened, the pull request is
# labelled `STATE_LABEL_PREFIX`running, and when the task prompt names an issue
# one comment there names it — as a draft, or as not a draft because the
# repository's plan may not offer drafts — says the run's questions, lifecycle
# comments and progress go to it from now on while `COMMAND_HANDLE` commands
# keep working on the issue, adds this run's URL when `GITHUB_RUN_ID` is set,
# and ends with the `opened` marker. With no issue nothing is posted. Not
# opened is one `::warning::` line naming why and saying the run goes on, its
# comments reach the issue and `deliver` tries again at the run's end; nothing
# is posted, since `deliver`'s `completed` comment is the one notification.
# It never fails its caller: every outcome but a usage error is exit 0.
#
# `deliver` HANDS A COMPLETED RUN TO REVIEW: the run workflow's step after the
# job's own `push-branch.sh`, which opens no pull request. Job-side for its
# root and self-gated, as `report` is (`forge_on`, one line when off). Anything
# but `status: completed` in <bundle_dir>/status.json, or no status.json, is
# one line and nothing sent. The bundle's `engine` names what completed:
# `user_review` is a round, anything else a run. An open same-repository pull
# request whose head is <branch> is reused and no second one is opened. With
# none open and a lookup that succeeded, `forge_open_pr` is the fallback — one
# line says none was open at completion, because the start's attempt failed or
# the workflow predates `open`. It is created against `defaultBranch`, titled
# from the task prompt's `# ` first line (cut to `PR_TITLE_MAX_CHARS`, else
# <branch>), with a body naming the issue as `Started from #<n>.` — a plain
# mention, never a closing keyword — stating what a review requesting changes
# and the `COMMAND_HANDLE` commands do, and ending with the `pull-request`
# marker: a `--draft` create with `HARNESS_PR_TOKEN` as `GH_TOKEN` when set, so
# the adopter's CI runs without an approval click, no retry on
# `PR_CREATE_FORBIDDEN`, one retry without `--draft` on any other failure. A
# pull request so opened is authored by that token's owner, who therefore
# cannot request changes on it: use a machine account's token, another
# reviewer, or a local `branch-user-review` round. A lookup that fails opens
# nothing. Then the ready flip, with the job's token and never
# `HARNESS_PR_TOKEN`: a draft gets one `gh pr ready` (flipped), and a refusal
# is one `::warning::` line naming gh's error (refused); a pull request that is
# not a draft — no drafts on the plan, or a person marked it ready — gets no
# call (not a draft) and is left alone. A round's review threads are handled
# next, after the flip and before the comments, with the job's token, per THE
# REVIEW-COMMENT LINE below: only when the pull request is known, the
# highest-numbered round file on origin's tip is the highest-numbered marked
# one (`round_markers_read`) — a round placed by the local command consumes no
# pull-request item — and its marker's `comments=` is non-empty; otherwise one
# line. Its fix plan is `<branch>_fix_plan.md` and `<branch>_fix_plan/` for
# round 1, `<branch>_fix_plan_<n>.md` and `<branch>_fix_plan_<n>/` for round
# <n>, read from origin's tip. A verdict is kept only for an id the round
# collected: `fixed <sha>` for an implemented finding, `reason <text>` for an
# out-of-scope bullet; a collected id with none is one line, left alone. One
# paginated `api graphql` listing of the pull request's `reviewThreads` (`id`,
# `isResolved`, each comment's `databaseId`, `createdAt` and `body`); the
# thread holding a collected id is that id's thread. Left alone, one line
# each: a thread already resolved; a thread with a comment created after the
# round's `collected_at` that is not a collected id and carries no
# `COMMENT_MARKER` — the reviewer replied after the collection; and a thread
# already carrying this round's `thread` marker (` round=<n>` included), so a
# re-run of the same round replies nothing twice while a later round still
# handles a thread an earlier round replied to. Otherwise one reply, through
# `pulls/<pr>/comments/<id>/replies` to the thread's first comment, ending with
# `forge_marker thread <branch>` and the round's ` round=<n>` — whose
# `COMMENT_MARKER` keeps the next `round_collect` from collecting it: for
# `fixed`, ``Addressed in `<sha>`.`` and, only once that reply is posted, one
# `resolveReviewThread` mutation; for `reason`, `Not changed in this round:
# <reason>`, the thread left open. A refused listing, reply or resolve is one
# `::warning::` line. It never dismisses a review.
# THE REVIEW-COMMENT LINE is this file's contract, written by one writer,
# `plugin/agents/user-review-fix-plan-writer.md`, and read by `deliver` alone:
#   - in a per-finding file `<state_dir>/user_reviews/<branch>_fix_plan[_<n>]/
#     finding_<K>.md`, one line beginning `**Review comments:** ` followed by
#     one or more comment ids separated by `, `, e.g.
#     `**Review comments:** 2735551234, 2735551240`;
#   - in the fix-plan index's `## Out of scope / verified-OK` section, a bullet
#     (a line beginning `- `) ending with ` **Review comments:** <id>[, <id>…]`,
#     its text before that suffix the reason the reply quotes;
#   - the ids are the round marker's `comments=` ids, GitHub's review-comment
#     `id`s; an observation from no inline comment carries no such line;
#   - finding <K> is implemented when the index carries the literal
#     `[x] **Finding <K>**`, and its fix commit is the oldest commit on
#     `origin/<branch>` that introduced that literal into the index (`git log
#     --reverse -S`), else origin's tip — the committer flips the entry in the
#     fix's own commit.
# Then one `completed` comment
# on the pull request, its readiness clause by the flip's outcome, and one on
# the issue naming the pull request's number and URL, each when known; with no
# pull request, one comment on the issue alone naming why none could be opened
# — the Actions setting and `HARNESS_GIT_TOKEN` on `PR_CREATE_FORBIDDEN`, else
# gh's error — with the branch's compare URL; nowhere when neither is known.
# Each names reviewing and requesting changes as the next action, and with
# `phases.qa` true the local `branch-qa-test` still owed. Then
# `sdlc-harness: done` on the issue and the pull request, each when known. It
# writes at most one pull request, one flip, a round's thread replies and
# resolves, two comments and those labels, and never pushes. It never fails its caller: every problem, a refused flip
# included, is one line and exit 0.
#
# `collect` STARTS THE NEXT ROUND FROM THE REVIEWS COLLECTED DURING A RUN: the
# one step of the run workflow's `collect` job, which follows its `run` job, so
# a review `control` answered "collected" waits at most for the run in flight.
# Job-side for its root and self-gated, as `report` and `deliver` are
# (`forge_on`, one line when off). In order, each stop one line and exit 0:
# `HARNESS_REMOTE_STOP` set; `remote_branch_stopped` finding the branch stopped,
# or failing; `branch_settled_var`, read as `control` reads it, failing; the
# newest run's job never started — when that run is this one (or
# `GITHUB_RUN_ID` is unset), `report`'s `not_started` on its pull request or
# issue, with the state and engine the read derived, and one push notification,
# no round collected, since the reviews stay for the resumed run's own end;
# when it is another run, one line, since that run's own `collect` reports it;
# no pull request, from --pr or else `forge_pr_var` (a failed lookup
# included); the settledness read finding the
# branch in flight — a newer run listed, or this run ending `parked`,
# `park_loop` or `paused` (a budget chain's included), whose own end collects
# next; `round_collect` finding no review requesting changes
# pending (inline comments alone start no round, as *Comment* starts none; they
# ride along in the next), or failing, a `::warning::` line. Otherwise `review
# <branch> --review-file <file> --allow-no-run --reviewers <logins> --source
# <pull request url>` runs as a child, as `control` runs it, placing,
# dispatching and reporting the round. A child that exits non-zero gets exactly
# one comment on the pull request, with the `reply` marker, naming its last
# stderr line and saying the reviews stay there and that, when `GITHUB_RUN_ID`
# is set, re-running this run's `collect` job retries with no new review, and
# that submitting a review requesting changes retries; there is no automatic
# retry. It never fails its
# caller: every outcome but a usage error is exit 0.
#
# `control` IS THE COMMENT AND REVIEW ADAPTER, the twin of `trigger` and the one
# step of the `WORKFLOW_CONTROL_FILE` job: one GitHub event -> one action on
# exactly one branch, carried out by this script's own verbs run as children,
# so it composes no dispatch itself. Job-side for its root, as `trigger` is,
# and outside the sending-verb gate: it gates itself after reading the event,
# so a refusal can still be replied to. The workflow's `if:` only saves a
# runner; every rule below holds without it. It handles `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`
# `issue_comment`, `pull_request_review` (THE REVIEW, below), and `issues`,
# `pull_request` and `delete` (THE CLOSE, below); any other name, or an event
# file it cannot read, exits 1.
# It reads `.action`, `.comment.body`, `.issue.number`,
# `.issue.pull_request.url`, `.sender.login` and `.sender.type`, each by `jq`
# into a variable (data, never shell source), plus `trigger`'s environment.
# Ignored, with one line and no `gh` call: an action other than `created`; a
# body carrying `COMMENT_MARKER` anywhere (the harness's own comment, whoever
# posted it); and a body that does not hold `COMMAND_HANDLE` as a word
# anywhere, compared lowercase (the ERE `(^|[^a-z0-9])<handle>([^a-z0-9-]|$)`).
# So `pause` and `foo@sdlc-harnessx` start nothing. THE EXACT FORM is a first
# line — a trailing CR stripped, leading spaces and tabs skipped — opening with
# a word equal to `COMMAND_HANDLE`, compared lowercase, whose next word,
# lowercased, is a `COMMAND_VERBS` word: that is the verb, and `CONTROL_ARGS`
# the rest of that line. Any other body holding the handle is A MENTION
# (`CONTROL_MENTION`, no verb): `Let's @sdlc-harness pause`, `> @sdlc-harness
# pause`, the handle on a later line, and `@sdlc-harness check the question`
# alike, each read by MENTION below. Then refused, in this order, each a reply
# and exit 2:
#   1. `HARNESS_REMOTE_STOP` is set
#   2. `forge_on` fails — before any authorisation, so a disabled coupling asks
#      GitHub nothing about the commenter
#      then a re-run whose GITHUB_TRIGGERING_ACTOR `rerun_actor_listed`
#      refuses, before the event's own actor is checked
#   3. `authorise_actor` fails: `AUTH_WHY`, and who may command a run — a
#      writer the `HARNESS_RUN_ACTORS` allow-list admits, or a listed bot
#   4. the exact form's verb is one no arm carries out (`control_verb_handled`;
#      no such word exists today): the reply lists every command and names
#      `docs/github-run-control.md`. Skipped for a mention.
# Then THE BRANCH, and the exact form's arm (`control_run_verb`) or MENTION.
# `--needs-agent` answers only whether MENTION would start a session: the
# intake above, then refusals 1 to 3 (`control_gates`, shared with `control`),
# run alone, posting, dispatching and creating nothing; its one `gh` call is
# `authorise_actor`'s permission call, and the branch is never resolved. One
# stdout line each: exit 0 `needs-agent: yes, a mention by @<login> on #<n>`;
# exit 2 `needs-agent: no, <reason>` for an event other than `issue_comment`,
# an ignored comment (after its own line), the exact form (before any gate,
# no `gh` call), or a refusal, whose <reason> is that refusal's reply text;
# exit 3 `needs-agent: undecided, <AUTH_WHY>` when the permission call failed
# (`control` still refuses that with exit 2); exit 1 as `control`'s.
# `WORKFLOW_CONTROL_FILE` runs it before installing the agent; the act step,
# plain `control`, still re-checks everything.
# MENTION. `verb_control`'s first statements, for every event, copy `IN_OAUTH`
# / `IN_API` into the non-exported `MENTION_OAUTH` / `MENTION_API` and unset
# them, with `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, so no `gh`, `git`
# or `control_child` process the job spawns inherits a credential; only the
# agent subshell receives it. After the gates and the branch, `control_mention`
# reads the state (`control_state_var`; a failed read is exit 3), then refuses
# with no session: no saved credential (exit 2, the reply listing every
# command); no `commands/<basename of MENTION_COMMAND>.md` under
# `HARNESS_MENTION_PLUGIN_DIR` (exit 3, naming `HARNESS_CLI_VERSION` in
# `harness-run.yml` and `docs/remote-execution.md` -> `### Upgrading`); and an
# agent binary, `${HARNESS_AGENT_CLI:-claude}`, that `command -v` does not
# resolve (exit 3). The plugin directory is a path only: nothing under it is
# sourced or run by this script. THE CONTEXT DIRECTORY, a fresh one under
# `RUNNER_TEMP` (removed on exit): `comment.md` (`handle: <COMMAND_HANDLE>`,
# `Comment by @<login> on <issue|pull request> #<n>:`, a blank line, the body
# verbatim), `run.md` (`branch:`, the `fetch` keys, `stopped: yes|no`, the next
# ledger entry and its section, or that every entry is ticked or the ledger
# could not be read), `questions/question_<n>.md` per open question,
# `item.md` (`kind:`, `number:`, `title:`, `author:`, `url:`, a blank line, the
# body, from `api repos/<repo>/issues/<n>`), `conversation.md` (the last
# `MENTION_COMMENTS_MAX` comments before the commenter's own, oldest first,
# each `### @<login> at <at>`, `(posted by the harness)` when it carries
# `COMMENT_MARKER`, then its body, from the paginated comment listing) and, on
# a pull request, `diff.patch` (`pr diff`, text only: nothing is checked out),
# each capped at `MENTION_FILE_MAX_BYTES` at a whole line with a `(cut at <n>
# bytes)` line; a failed read is said in the file, never refused. THE SESSION runs once, never retried, in a subshell `cd` into
# that directory with `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `HARNESS_PR_TOKEN` unset
# and `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` exported from whichever
# saved value is set: `-p "$MENTION_COMMAND"` (no argument, so no comment text
# reaches argv) `--plugin-dir <dir> --add-dir <dir>/instructions
# --output-format json --json-schema <built by jq from MENTION_ACTIONS and
# COMMAND_VERBS> --tools Read,Grep,Glob --restricted --strict-mcp-config
# --no-session-persistence --permission-prompts none --model <agentModel>
# --max-budget-usd "$MENTION_MAX_BUDGET_USD"`, the model read through
# `hr_agent_model` (a command declares no `model:`) and the flag left off only
# when the configuration cannot be read; never `--bare`, which reads no
# OAuth token, and never `--disable-slash-commands`, which would stop the `-p`
# command expanding. The command is `plugin/commands/harness-read-mention.md`
# (`MENTION_COMMAND`), and it loads `plugin/instructions/mention_reading.md`,
# whose `## Output contract` restates the decision contract validated here: a
# field renamed on either side is an edit to both. A command declares no
# allowlist, so the read-only closure is the session's `--tools` and
# `--restricted` alone. EXTRACTION: a non-zero exit, stdout that is not one
# JSON object, `.is_error` true or a `.subtype` other than `success` is a
# failure, exit 3; the decision is `.structured_output` when an object, else
# `.result | fromjson?` when an object, and one stdout line logs it (`mention
# on #<n> by @<login> read as <action>[ <verb>] from <field>: <reason>`).
# VALIDATION, by `jq`, the sole authority whatever the schema did: `action` in
# `MENTION_ACTIONS`; `command` needs a `verb` in `COMMAND_VERBS`; `answer`
# needs a non-blank `answer` and an optional integer `question` of 1 or more;
# `reply` and `clarify` need a non-blank `text`; `reason` is a string. Unknown
# keys are ignored; an invalid decision is refused, exit 2, naming the first
# rule broken. Then, once and before any action is answered, a `text` or
# `answer` holding a saved credential value, or the job's `GH_TOKEN` raw or in
# the base64 form `actions/checkout` persists, verbatim, is an `::error::` line
# that never prints it, nothing posted, exit 3. THE ANSWERS, each through `control_post`:
# `none` posts nothing; `reply` / `clarify` post `@<login>: <text>` — `text`
# through `JQ_DEF_SANITISE` (`<!--` neutralised, every other `@<login>` but the
# commenter's and the handle given U+200B) and capped at
# `MENTION_TEXT_MAX_BYTES` with a `(cut)` line — then a footer saying an agent
# wrote it and changed nothing, listing the commands; `fixes` posts this
# script's text pointing at a review requesting changes or
# `/autonomous-sdlc-harness:branch-user-review`; `command` with a verb in
# `MENTION_ACT_VERBS` is carried out by that verb's own arm (`control_run_verb`)
# from the exact form's `CONTROL_ARGS` and `CONTROL_BODY` — for `answer`, the
# command line then the decision's `answer` below it, byte for byte — every
# reply the arm posts opening with `CONTROL_MENTION_NOTE`, `Read from your
# mention as` and that form, `answer` adding the answer fenced by
# `JQ_DEF_FENCE` after `JQ_DEF_SANITISE`; an `answer` carrying a credential
# value was refused above, so it reaches neither the answer file, the dispatch
# nor the note; a state the arm refuses is that arm's refusal and exit,
# unchanged. `command` with a verb in `MENTION_CONFIRM_VERBS` posts a
# confirmation request naming the exact form it was read as and carries out no
# verb: `stop` because it is destructive, `clear` because on GitHub typing it
# is `branch-resume`'s confirmation. Exits: 0 answered or nothing to do; 2
# refused; 3 a state read, plugin, binary or agent failure, or a credential
# value in `text` or `answer`; a carried-out verb, its arm's. The workflow's
# interface: `IN_OAUTH` / `IN_API`, `HARNESS_MENTION_PLUGIN_DIR`, and
# `control --needs-agent`'s exit 2, on which it skips installing the agent.
# THE BRANCH. On a pull request (`.issue.pull_request.url` set), its head, by
# `pr view`: a fork's pull request is refused, because this event carries the
# repository's secrets, and nothing from its head is checked out or run; one
# not `OPEN` is refused. On an issue, the branch of the LAST genuine start
# comment, read by a paginated comment listing: its author is
# `github-actions[bot]`, its first line opens with the trigger's sentence
# `Started a harness run on the branch ` and a backticked <b>, and its last
# non-empty line is byte for byte what `forge_marker started <b>` prints. A
# marker quoted mid-body, in a comment not opening with that sentence, or by
# anyone else, is never trusted; none is a refusal. Both paths then pass
# `control_check_branch`: a branch `hr_branch_is_protected` does not answer 1
# for is refused, then it is fetched. It is a harness branch when its origin
# tip carries its task prompt or the flow-progress ledger (`forge_recognised`)
# — the task prompt, `start`'s first commit, makes a pull request opened at
# the run's start commandable before the ledger's first push; or, for a command
# typed on an issue, when it is the branch that issue's genuine `started`
# marker names and it still exists on origin (`remote_branch_exists`) — the
# marker shows the harness started a run on it, so a first run GitHub never
# started, which committed only its task prompt, is still commandable; an
# issue keeps its marker after its branch is deleted, so a marker-named branch
# gone from origin is refused as deleted, and a failed existence check is a
# refusal naming the read; or when a `harness run <branch>` run is queued,
# waiting, requested, pending or in progress (`control_run_in_flight`), so a
# run is commandable from its first minute on its pull request too. Otherwise
# it is not a harness branch. A failed listing is a refusal naming the read.
# THE ARMS. `pause`: the state by a `fetch` child (`control_state_var`); only
# `running` sends `pause <branch>` as a child and replies that the run yields at
# its next clean checkpoint; any other state is a refusal naming it. `stop`:
# state `none` is a refusal; otherwise `stop <branch> --actor <login>` as a
# child, which posts its own `stopped` comment to the run's target; on 0 a reply
# is ALWAYS posted where the command was typed too, so a command on the issue of
# a branch with a pull request is answered there; on 3 the reply says the stop
# was partial and to comment `stop` again. `resume` accepts only `paused`, any
# `pause_reason` (`expired` and `killed` included); `park_loop` is refused
# pointing at `clear`, `parked` pointing at `answer <n>` with the open indexes,
# `running`, `completed`, `failed` and `none` each naming the state. `clear`
# accepts only `park_loop`, the GitHub form of `branch-resume`'s confirmation;
# any other state is a refusal naming it. Each sends the local relay's dispatch,
# `dispatch <branch> --engine <the state's engine> --resume pause --chain 0`,
# `clear` with `park_loop_clear` set, and no other command sets it. A run whose
# job GitHub never started first takes the engine its dispatch's comment
# records (`forge_dispatch_engine_var`); an engine still empty after that is
# refused, never guessed (the `engine` input defaults to `task`), and the
# refusal names the Run workflow form. On 0 a reply, then `running` on the run's issue
# and pull request; on 2 a refusal and exit 2. `answer`: the first line is
# `answer <n>` and the answer every line below it, a trailing CR stripped from
# each line and its bytes otherwise unchanged; text after <n> on the first line
# is the answer when nothing follows below, and with no positive-integer <n>
# all of that line's text is. <n> may be left out only when exactly one
# question is open — issue comments have no threads. Refused, each a reply and
# exit 2: an empty answer; `park_loop` (pointing at `clear`); `paused` /
# `expired`, quoting its detail and pointing at `resume`, never treated as no
# park; `running`, naming the run, so a second answer never queues behind a job
# that a newer pending run in the per-branch `concurrency` group could cancel;
# any state but `parked`; no open question; several open and no <n>; an <n> not
# open, listing the open set; an empty engine, naming the Run workflow form.
# Otherwise the answer is written by `printf` (data, never shell source) to
# `answer_<n>.md` in a fresh directory under `RUNNER_TEMP`, and sent as
# `dispatch <branch> --engine <engine> --resume answer --answers-from <dir>
# --indexes <n> --chain 0`: one answer, one dispatch with one entry. That is
# safe because an `answer` job whose park is not fully answered stops parked
# before any session (`autonomous-watcher.sh` -> `run_job`), its bundle then
# carrying the `answer_<n>.md` restore wrote, so the next answer's job finds the
# set complete. The payload limit is `dispatch`'s alone: its refusal is quoted,
# with shortening the answer or committing it to a file on the branch as the
# way on. On 0 with no other question open, a reply that the run resumes and
# `running` on its issue and pull request; with others open, a reply naming
# them, and the label stays `parked`. An answer becomes a comment on the item,
# public on a public repository, as the question already is. A STOPPED RUN IS
# NAMED `stopped`: a stop leaves the bundle as it was, so after `pause`,
# `resume`, `answer` and `clear` read the state, `control_state_word_var` asks
# `remote_branch_stopped` (one extra run listing) whether a `running`,
# `parked`, `park_loop` or `paused` run was stopped, and every reply names it
# `stopped`, with the state underneath where the way on depends on it. The
# states each verb accepts are unchanged, except that `pause` refuses a
# stopped `running` run, whose cancelled job is still finishing: `resume`
# still resumes a stopped `paused` run, and on a stopped `parked` run the
# answer, on a stopped `park_loop` run the clear, is its resume. `status` is
# READ-ONLY and accepted in every state, `none` and a run in flight included:
# it reads the state (`control_state_var`, `control_state_word_var`) and the
# first `- [ ] ` entry of the flow-progress ledger on origin's tip with the
# `## ` heading above it, and replies once — the state by `CS_WORD` with its
# pause reason, the state underneath a stopped one, an expired bundle's detail,
# the next ledger entry (or, on a fully ticked ledger, that a user-review round
# has started and its ledger is not written yet, when origin's tip carries the
# round's `chore: add user review for <branch>` commit after the ledger's last
# change; else, for a `running` run, that it is still finishing or starting a
# stage, never that every entry is ticked; else that every entry is ticked; or
# that the ledger could not be read), each open question with its `answer <n>` form, and the
# latest run's URL. It sets no label and runs no child verb but `fetch`; a
# failed state read is a refusal and exit 3.
# THE REVIEW. A `pull_request_review` event reads `.action`, `.review.state`,
# `.review.body`, `.review.id`, `.review.html_url`, `.review.submitted_at`,
# `.pull_request.number`, `.pull_request.head.ref`,
# `.pull_request.head.repo.full_name`, `.sender.login` and `.sender.type`.
# Ignored, with one line and no `gh` call: an action other than `submitted`; a
# state other than `REVIEW_ROUND_STATE`, compared lowercase (the REST API
# reports it uppercase); a body carrying `COMMENT_MARKER`; and a head
# repository other than `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, not even replied to, because a
# fork's review job holds a read-only token. So *Comment* and *Approve* start
# nothing, and draft status plays no part. Then gates 1-3 above, in order, each
# a reply on the pull request, and `control_check_branch` on the head; then a
# head whose origin tip carries no `<state>/story_plans/<head>_story_plan.md`
# is refused, because the round reads its story index. A REVIEW IS NEVER
# REFUSED FOR A RUN IN FLIGHT. The head is read by `branch_settled_var`, no run
# counting as settled, in a command substitution so a failed read is a reply
# (exit 3) rather than an exit with none. Not settled: a reply and exit 0,
# nothing pushed or dispatched — `your review is part of round <n>, which is
# <state>` when a marker on origin's tip records the event's review id, else
# `your review was collected`, naming the state and saying the next round
# starts by itself when that run finishes, plus the state's way on: `answer
# <n>` for `parked`, `clear` for `park_loop`, `resume` for any `paused` but
# `usage`, and for `usage` that it resumes after the reset. A run of those
# states that `remote_branch_stopped` finds stopped is named `stopped`, and its
# way on is the one `resume` names for it: `answer <n>`, `clear`, `resume`, or
# for `running` `resume` once the cancelled job has ended. The review stays on
# the pull request, and a later round collects it. Settled: a round is CUMULATIVE,
# built by `round_collect` in a fresh file under `RUNNER_TEMP` from ONE
# paginated `pulls/<n>/reviews` and ONE paginated `pulls/<n>/comments` listing
# — never the per-review endpoint, which carries no `line` — the event's own
# review merged when the listing lacks it. What earlier rounds consumed is the
# union of the review and comment ids their marker lines record, read from
# origin's tip; the time boundary is the highest-numbered marked round's
# `collected_at` less `ROUND_OVERLAP_SECS`, or, when no round is marked, the
# committer time of the branch's newest `user_reviews/<head>_review[_<n>].md`
# (none when there is no round). Pending: a submitted review (never
# `PENDING`) whose id is unrecorded, whose body carries no `COMMENT_MARKER`,
# whose `submitted_at` is at or after the boundary, and which either has state
# `REVIEW_ROUND_STATE` or a non-blank body; and an
# inline comment, by any author and whatever its review's state, whose id is
# unrecorded, whose body carries no `COMMENT_MARKER`, and whose `created_at` is
# at or after the boundary or whose review is pending. Every distinct author
# of a pending item passes `authorise_actor`, the `HARNESS_RUN_ACTORS`
# allow-list included; a refused author's items — a writer the list refuses
# among them — are dropped with one line naming the login, `AUTH_WHY` and the
# count, and a failed permission call (status 4) fails the collection. A round is placed only when at
# least one kept review has state `REVIEW_ROUND_STATE`; a *Comment* or
# *Approve* review rides along in the next round one requesting changes starts.
# The file: one `## Review by @<login>` section per pending review, oldest
# `submitted_at` first, holding the body verbatim (or `(The review carries no
# summary.)`) and a provenance line naming its state — `Requested changes on
# pull request #<n> (<url>) at <submitted_at>.`, `Commented on pull request
# …`, `Approved pull request …`, `Reviewed pull request … at <submitted_at>;
# the review has since been dismissed.`, or for any other state `Reviewed
# pull request … at <submitted_at> (state <state>).`; then, when any is
# kept, `## Inline comments`, oldest `created_at` first; then the marker line
# `<!-- sdlc-harness round collected_at=<utc> reviews=<id,…> comments=<id,…> -->`
# listing exactly the ids written. Each comment is a `### `<path>`, line
# <n>` heading (`original line <n> (outdated)` when `line` is null), `Made on
# commit `<original_commit_id or commit_id>`.`, `By @<login>: <url>`, its body
# verbatim, and its `diff_hunk` in a `diff` fence one backtick longer than the
# hunk's longest backtick run, at least three — the commit and hunk let the fix plan re-locate
# a line the fixes moved. With no review pending, nothing is placed: a reply
# names the round whose marker records the event's review, else says nothing
# is pending, and exit 0. Then `review <head> --review-file <file>
# --allow-no-run --reviewers <logins> --source <pull request url>` runs as a
# child, which fast-forwards, commits `chore: add user review for <head>`, pushes,
# dispatches `engine: user_review`, waits for its run to be listed and reports
# the round itself. Its 0 is exit 0 with nothing more posted; 2 means the branch
# became unsettled between the two reads, answered with the in-flight reply
# above (the state read again) and exit 0; 3 a reply quoting the re-send line,
# exit 3; 4 a reply that placement failed and nothing was dispatched, exit 4.
# A refusal reads `@<login>: `review` was not run: …`, and no reply to a review
# asks for it to be submitted again to be kept: a reply that started nothing
# says the reviews stay on the pull request for the next round, and that
# submitting a review requesting changes retries now.
# A child's failure is a reply
# naming its last stderr line, and exit 3. Every reply goes to the item the comment was
# typed on, opens `@<login>`, and carries the `reply` marker; a reply posted
# after a successful dispatch adds ` engine=<engine>` to that marker, the engine
# the dispatch named, so a run whose job never ran can still be resumed with
# it. A refusal reads `@<login>: `<verb>` was not run: <reason>. <way on>`.
# THE CLOSE. Whatever the run's phase, it is stopped when its issue is closed,
# its pull request closed or merged, or its branch deleted; the routing is by
# event name, never by verb, so a comment naming `close` is not one. `issues`
# reads `.action`, `.issue.number`, `.sender.login`, `.sender.type`;
# `pull_request` reads `.action`, `.pull_request.number`,
# `.pull_request.merged`, `.pull_request.head.ref`,
# `.pull_request.head.repo.full_name` and the sender; `delete` reads `.ref`,
# `.ref_type` and the sender — each by `event_field`. Ignored, with one line
# and no `gh` call: an action other than `closed`; a pull request whose head
# repository is not `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`; a `ref_type` other than `branch`, or
# a ref `valid_branch` rejects. A CLOSE IS NEVER REPLIED TO: each gate below,
# in order, is one line and exit 0, with no comment, label or dispatch —
#   1. `HARNESS_REMOTE_STOP` is set
#   2. `forge_on` fails
#   3. the actor: on `issues` and `pull_request`, `authorise_actor` refused
#      (statuses 1–3 and 5, so a writer the `HARNESS_RUN_ACTORS` allow-list
#      refuses is ignored too), the line naming the login and `AUTH_WHY`; on
#      `delete`, only a `Bot` sender `trigger_bot_listed` does not list, and
#      never the allow-list: deleting a branch already needs write access, the
#      run's branch is gone, and a stop spends no credential
#   4. no branch: an issue's from `control_issue_branch_var` (no genuine start
#      comment), a pull request's head ref, a deletion's `.ref`; then not a
#      valid branch name
#   5. `hr_branch_is_protected` does not answer 1
#   6. on `pull_request`, the head branch absent on origin (`remote_branch_exists`
#      answers 1): GitHub closed the pull request because the branch was
#      deleted, and the `delete` event's job stops the run and reports it on
#      this pull request; an `ls-remote` that
#      cannot answer is one line and proceeds
# There is no harness-branch check (`forge_recognised`): a merged or deleted
# branch may no longer carry its task prompt or ledger, and a listed `harness run <b>` run is the
# proof. The state is read by `control_state_var`: only `running`, `parked`,
# `park_loop` and `paused` are acted on; `completed`, `failed` and `none` are
# `left alone: the run on <b> is <state>`, and one `remote_branch_stopped`
# already finds stopped is `already stopped` — each one line and exit 0. Then
# `stop <b> --actor <login> --note <note>` runs as a child (`control_child`),
# the note `Stopped because @<login> closed issue #<n>.`, `… closed pull
# request #<n>.` or `… merged pull request #<n>.` (both with `--pr <n>`), or
# `… deleted the branch `<b>`.` (with `--branch-gone`). Every note but the
# deletion's adds that the workflow runs and their `harness-state` artifacts
# are kept; a closed pull request's `stopped` comment says to reopen it, or to
# use the issue, before commenting `@sdlc-harness resume`. The runs and
# artifacts are kept. Reopening the issue or the pull
# request does nothing. A `pull_request` close job runs the pull request's
# merge-commit copy of the workflow, as a review job does
# (docs/github-integration-research.md -> C2); the script stays the default
# branch's.
#     0  handled (replied), or ignored; a close stopped, or ignored (one line)
#     1  not an event named above, or the event could not be read
#     2  refused (replied)
#     3  a `gh` step failed: the reply could not be posted (an `::error::`
#        line), or the action failed and was replied to; for a close, an
#        `::error::` line and no reply, because the item is closed: the stop
#        child failed (naming `CHILD_LAST`), or the repository name, the
#        closer's permission, the issue's comments or the run's state could
#        not be read
#     4  a review's round could not be placed; nothing was dispatched (replied)
#
# `restore` AND `save` ARE THE JOB-SIDE VERBS: the run workflow calls them in
# its job, before and (under `always()`) after the harness step. Without
# `--repo` they act on the checkout of the working directory (`hr_repo_root`),
# not the main checkout. They test neither `execution.target` nor a registry
# record: the job exists because a dispatch passed the target gate, and a
# fresh job checkout carries no registry.
#
# WORKFLOW INPUTS REACH THEM THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENT, NEVER A `${{ }}`
# EXPRESSION INTERPOLATED INTO A SHELL LINE — an input is attacker-shaped text,
# and interpolation makes it shell source. The workflow sets them with `env:`:
#   HARNESS_INPUT_ANSWERS          the `answers` input (restore --resume answer)
#   HARNESS_INPUT_PARK_LOOP_CLEAR  the `park_loop_clear` input (restore)
# `GITHUB_RUN_ID` (restore: this run is never its own previous run) and
# `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` (save) are the runner's own.
#
# `restore` SELECTS the newest `completed` run titled `harness run <branch>`,
# other than `GITHUB_RUN_ID`, carrying a `harness-state` artifact — walking
# past a run with none, and stopping at one whose artifact has expired, since
# an older copy would be staler state. An expired one restores nothing: under
# --resume answer it exits 2; otherwise it prints a `::warning::` line naming
# the run, the expiry and the lost counts, clarification history and
# uncommitted planning drafts, and the job continues from the committed ledger. An unexpired one it downloads to `<state_dir>/autonomous_logs/remote_download/<branch>/<id>/`
# (skipped when that directory already holds its status.json); and restores it
# in `job` mode — on every --resume kind, `none` included, because a reused
# branch keeps its clarification history. A job-mode restore also places the
# bundle's `planning/` drafts at their paths under the state directory, never
# over a file the checkout already has, and when it placed or kept any prints
# `placed <n> planning file(s) for <branch>; kept <n> the checkout already
# carries`. Then, under --resume answer, it
# writes each `"<n>": "<text>"` entry to `clarifications/<branch>/answer_<n>.md`
# with the exact bytes, after checking every entry first; and with
# `HARNESS_INPUT_PARK_LOOP_CLEAR` exactly `true` it sets `park_loop_cycles` to
# "0" in the restored `autonomous_logs/remote_status.json`. No bundle in any
# candidate run is an ordinary first job (exit 0, one line) except under
# --resume answer, whose refusal names the current lineage.
#
# THE CANDIDATES ARE BOUNDED TO THE BRANCH'S CURRENT LINEAGE, so a branch
# recreated under a reused name never restores an earlier, unrelated run's
# bundle. The listing reads each run's `headSha`, and `lineage_commits_var`
# lists `git rev-list refs/remotes/origin/<defaultBranch>..HEAD` in the job's
# checkout; a run whose `headSha` is not among those commits, or that carries
# none, is dropped before the walk, so the expired-bundle stop applies to
# lineage runs only. When any was dropped it prints `skipped <n> finished
# run(s) of <branch> from before its current lineage`. When the lineage cannot
# be listed — the configuration unreadable, `origin/<defaultBranch>` not
# present, or HEAD carrying no commit beyond it — every finished run is a
# candidate, as before the bound, and it prints `the lineage of <branch> is
# not bounded (<reason>); every finished run of it is a candidate`.
#
# `save` WRAPS `hr_remote_bundle_write` into <out_dir>, and with
# `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` set appends a Markdown table of the bundle's `status`,
# `decision` and `detail`. With no `autonomous_logs/remote_status.json` and no
# registry file the harness step never started: <out_dir> is created empty,
# with no status.json — what `continue` reads as "never started". A
# `remote_status.json` whose `run_id` is not `GITHUB_RUN_ID` is the previous
# job's copy that `restore` placed. This job's harness step never wrote its
# own, so `save` moves it aside to `remote_status.json.previous` and decides as
# if it were absent. It never
# fails the job: every problem, a usage error included, is one line on stderr
# and exit 0.
#
# `continue` AND `poll` CLOSE THE LOOP WITHOUT THIS MACHINE, and like `restore`
# and `save` test neither `execution.target` nor a registry record. `continue`
# is the run workflow's last job step (under `!cancelled()`); `poll` is the
# whole body of the resume poller, `WORKFLOW_RESUME_FILE`. Both read, from the
# environment the workflows set:
#   HARNESS_MAX_CHAIN    the automatic-dispatch limit; `24` when empty. Not a
#                        non-negative integer: nothing is dispatched
#   HARNESS_POLL_MAX_DISPATCH_FAILURES   `poll` only: failed re-dispatches of
#                        one paused run, and consecutive failed downloads of
#                        one run's listed bundle, each counted apart, before it
#                        gives up; `3` when empty
#   HARNESS_POLL_GIVE_UP_AFTER_MINUTES   `poll` only: minutes after a run's
#                        `usage_resume_at` past which a failed re-dispatch gives
#                        up; `360` when empty. Either one not a non-negative
#                        integer: nothing is dispatched
#   HARNESS_REMOTE_STOP  non-empty: nothing is dispatched
#   HARNESS_REMOTE_SLUG  exported as `HARNESS_REPO_SLUG` before a notification,
#                        so it names the repository rather than a runner path
#   GITHUB_RUN_ID, GITHUB_SERVER_URL, GITHUB_REPOSITORY   the run URL
# Notifications go through the sibling `autonomous-notify.sh`, as `paused` or
# `failed`, and each is then reported as `report` reports that event, with a
# note of its own that names no slash command and no shell command. The one
# exception is `poll`'s push-only `bundle_unreadable`, which posts no comment
# and sets no label. A re-dispatch is `dispatch <branch> --engine <status.json engine>
# --resume pause --chain <chain + 1>`, composed by `dispatch` itself.
#
# `chain` HAS ONE SOURCE: the bundle's `status.json`, whose `chain` is the
# writing job's own input — never `HARNESS_INPUT_CHAIN`, the registry or a
# run's inputs. So `chain + 1` is one more than the job that wrote the bundle,
# and a user's dispatch (chain 0) restarts the count. An absent or non-integer
# `chain` is a chain-limit refusal ("chain unreadable"), never 0.
#
# `continue <branch> <bundle_dir>` reads the bundle `save` just wrote:
#   no status.json   the harness step never started: one `failed` naming the
#                    run URL, no dispatch
#   decision continue   refused, in this order: `HARNESS_REMOTE_STOP` set (one
#                    `paused`); the branch stopped (one log line, no
#                    notification — the user asked for it); the branch absent
#                    on origin (one log line, no notification; an
#                    `ls-remote` that cannot answer is one line and proceeds,
#                    since the dispatch then fails loudly); chain unreadable
#                    or `chain + 1` over `HARNESS_MAX_CHAIN` (one `failed`);
#                    otherwise re-dispatched. A dispatch that fails is one
#                    `paused` naming its error
#   decision wait-poller   the branch stopped, or absent on origin: one log
#                    line (an `ls-remote` that cannot answer is one line and
#                    proceeds). Otherwise `gh workflow enable
#                    WORKFLOW_RESUME_FILE`; a failed enable
#                    (the job token's enable permission is unverified) is one
#                    `paused` saying auto-resume is unavailable
#   decision stop    nothing: job mode has already notified
# A job killed by its step timeout re-dispatches, because job mode writes
# `decision: continue` the moment it starts; `HARNESS_MAX_CHAIN` is what bounds
# a job that is killed every time.
#
# WHY RE-DISPATCH IS NOT LEFT TO `!cancelled()` ALONE. A user's `stop` cancels a
# running job, so its `continue` step never runs — but a usage-paused run
# waiting for the poller has no job to cancel. The stop marker reaches it:
# `remote_branch_stopped` finds a branch stopped when its newest run titled
# `harness stop <branch>` was created after its newest `harness run <branch>`,
# from one bounded newest-first listing of every branch. A marker outside the
# window is older than every `harness run` inside it, and a user's later
# dispatch is newer than the marker, so it un-stops the branch with no extra
# step. It runs ahead of every dispatch and every enable. A listing that fails
# fails CLOSED in `continue`: nothing sent, one `paused` naming gh's error.
#
# `poll` FIRST CARRIES ITS STATE: the newest run of `WORKFLOW_RESUME_FILE` other
# than `GITHUB_RUN_ID` (bounded) carrying an unexpired `harness-poll-state`
# artifact is downloaded to `<state_dir>/autonomous_logs/poll_state/previous/`;
# any failure to find or read it is one line and an empty state. Its
# `poll_state.json` is {"<branch>": {"run_id", "failures", "notified",
# "download_failures"}}, the last absent until a download fails; an
# entry whose `run_id` is not the branch's newest `harness run` run is dropped,
# so a new run restarts the count. `poll` writes the state to `poll_state/
# current/` on every exit, `HARNESS_REMOTE_STOP` included, and the poller
# uploads that directory.
#
# `poll`: `HARNESS_REMOTE_STOP` set exits 0 with nothing sent. Otherwise one
# listing; each branch's newest `harness run <branch>` run decides. A run not
# yet `completed` is never dispatched (its own `continue` will decide): with no
# `harness-state` artifact it is skipped, not waiting; with one whose bundle
# says `status: paused` / `pause_reason: usage` it is waiting, because the job
# uploads before its `continue` step enables the poller; an artifact lookup or
# download that fails for it is one line and waiting. For a `completed` run,
# skipped, not waiting: a stopped branch, a branch absent on origin (its state
# entry dropped, so a later branch of the name starts clean; an `ls-remote`
# that cannot answer is one line and proceeds), a run whose `run` job GitHub
# never started (one line; its `collect` job reports it), and anything but
# `status: paused` / `pause_reason: usage` with an integer `usage_resume_at`,
# and a run whose state entry says `notified`. A failed artifact lookup on a
# `completed` run counts as a failed download of its bundle, below. A listed
# bundle that cannot be downloaded is waiting, counted per run in `download_failures` and reset by a
# later successful download; at `HARNESS_POLL_MAX_DISPATCH_FAILURES`
# consecutive failures it sends exactly one `bundle_unreadable` push
# notification, with no comment and no label, the entry marked `notified`, and
# is no longer waiting. Due
# (reset passed): re-dispatched under the same chain limit — a refusal is one
# `failed` and not waiting; a success drops the branch's state entry. A
# dispatch that fails counts one more failure for that run and is still
# waiting, until the count reaches `HARNESS_POLL_MAX_DISPATCH_FAILURES` or the
# reset is over `HARNESS_POLL_GIVE_UP_AFTER_MINUTES` in the past: then exactly
# one `paused` naming the dispatch error and the resume command, the entry
# marked `notified`, and not waiting. Reset ahead: waiting. No branch waiting
# after the tick: `gh workflow disable WORKFLOW_RESUME_FILE`, then one fresh
# listing evaluated by the same rules with nothing sent or notified, skipping
# the branches this tick dispatched — a due run that would be dispatched counts
# as waiting there. A branch waiting now re-enables the poller, closing the
# window in which a finishing job enabled it before the disable; a re-listing
# that fails is one line and the poller stays disabled; a re-enable that fails
# is one `paused` per waiting branch. Bundles download to
# `<state_dir>/autonomous_logs/remote_download/<branch>/<id>/` in the checkout,
# skipped when that directory already holds its status.json.
#
# `pause-requested` AND `run-created-at` ARE THE JOB'S TWO READ VERBS, called by
# `autonomous-watcher.sh job`; like `restore` they test neither
# `execution.target` nor a registry record, run gh from `hr_repo_root` of the
# working directory unless `--repo` names one, and write nothing.
# `pause-requested` lists the branch's runs and exits 0 when one whose
# `displayTitle` is exactly `harness pause <branch>` has a `createdAt` at or
# after <since_epoch> — AT, because `createdAt` has one-second resolution and
# the caller passes a bound that starts at the job's own starting bound and
# afterwards lags each query by an overlap (`CONTROL_POLL_OVERLAP_SECS` in
# `autonomous-watcher.sh`), floored at that starting bound, so a pause created
# later in a second already queried is still seen; seeing one twice is
# harmless, since the caller drops PAUSE once. Exit 5 is "no pause"; exit 1 is
# a refused call and never one. `run-created-at` prints
# `gh run view <run_id> --json createdAt` as an epoch second.
#
# `status` AND `sync` READ THE RECORD, NOT THE KEY. A run keeps the execution
# it started with, so where a record exists they test its `execution` field and
# never `execution.target`; the configuration is still read for `stateDir`.
# Only `status` with no record reads the key.
#
# `status` WITH NO LOCAL RECORD (no registry file, or no record of the branch)
# is gated like a sending verb and answers from GitHub alone: the same runs
# listing, then `remote_state` with the bundle downloaded into a `mktemp -d`
# directory removed on exit, printing the state, pause reason, detail, engine
# and run URL, each open question (the rule `fetch` states) with its `## Q<k>`
# heading lines; an expired bundle's expired line is its `detail`. No `harness run
# <branch>` run listed prints one line and exits 0. There is no sync to compare
# against, so no finished-since line.
#
# `list` IS `branch-status`'s DIGEST: one listing (`list_all_runs`) and one
# `git ls-remote --heads origin`, never a bundle. It prints `on GitHub, no
# local record: <branch> <url>` for each branch `unrecorded_runs` keeps — its
# newest run titled exactly `harness run <branch>`, no registry record,
# unprotected and a live head on origin — or `no run on GitHub without a local
# record`.
#
# `status` WITH A RECORD WRITES NOTHING AT ALL — no registry (it does not even
# create an absent one), no download, no file. It prints the branch's newest runs titled
# `harness run <branch>` or `harness pause <branch>` (bounded), the record's
# `status`, `pause_reason`, `remote_run_url` and `remote_synced_at`, whether
# a `harness run` finished after the last sync, and — reading the newest
# finished run's artifact list — a line naming its bundle's expiry and the
# way on when that bundle has expired.
#
# `sync` READS THE NEWEST `harness run <branch>` RUN. Any status but
# `completed` (queued, in_progress, waiting, requested, pending) sets the record
# `running` and downloads nothing. Otherwise that run — the newest finished one
# — decides, in exactly one of five cases, tested in this order:
#   1. its id is the record's `remote_run_id`: already applied. Only
#      `remote_synced_at` is written; nothing is downloaded or restored, so an
#      answer written into the mirror since the last sync survives — unless
#      the record is `parked`, `park_loop` or `paused` (not already `expired`)
#      and that run's bundle has expired since: then as case 2
#   2. its `harness-state` artifact is listed only as expired: `paused` /
#      `expired`, `remote_run_id` / `remote_run_url` at this run, and
#      `remote_detail` naming the expiry and the way on (resume from the
#      committed ledger, or re-drop the task); nothing restored. The mirror's
#      question files stay, but no job can take an answer to them
#   3. it carries an unexpired `harness-state` artifact: downloaded (skipped
#      when the download directory already holds its status.json), restored in
#      `mirror` mode into the record's `worktree`, `run.log` copied to the main
#      checkout's `autonomous_logs/<branch>.remote.log`, and `status`,
#      `pause_reason`, `usage_resume_at`, `park_loop_cycles`, `remote_run_id`,
#      `remote_run_url`, `remote_detail` and `remote_synced_at` written, and
#      `engine` when the bundle names `task`, `user_review` or `docs`. A
#      `mirror` restore places no planning draft
#   4. no artifact, while some bundle exists (`remote_run_id` is set, or an
#      older finished run carries one): a job that died before its upload,
#      or that GitHub never started (the detail says so).
#      `paused` / `killed`, `remote_run_id` / `remote_run_url` re-pointed at
#      THIS run, and, for a run GitHub never started whose dispatch's comment
#      records its engine, `engine` set to that engine; nothing restored — so
#      a later sync with no newer run is case 1
#   5. no bundle in any run and an empty `remote_run_id`: `failed`. Not
#      `paused`: with no bundle anywhere a pause resume has nothing to restore,
#      and re-dropping the artifact is the recovery, except a run whose job
#      GitHub never started and whose engine its dispatch's comment records,
#      which `sync` records as case 4 does, `paused (killed)`
#
# THE `killed` AND `expired` MAPPINGS. A finished run whose bundle still says
# `running` (a kill, a timeout with no chain left) syncs as `status: paused`,
# `pause_reason: killed`; one whose bundle has expired syncs as `status:
# paused`, `pause_reason: expired`. Both are registry-only — `status.json`
# never carries either, because `sync` derives them from the run and its
# artifact list, never from a bundle. Both are `paused` rather than `failed`
# because a `failed` record has no resume path, while the ledger on the branch
# is intact and a resume continues from it. A finished run with no bundle
# whose `run` job GitHub never started (it ended `cancelled` or `failure` with
# no step run) maps to the same states as any other run with no bundle:
# `paused` / `killed` when an older run carries a bundle, else `failed`. Its
# detail names GitHub's reason instead of "killed, cancelled or replaced".
# A never-started run with no bundle anywhere whose engine its dispatch's
# comment records maps to `paused` / `killed` too, so `resume` accepts it.
# When that run was the branch's first, the branch has no ledger yet:
# `restore` finds no previous bundle and the resumed job starts as the
# branch's first. With no such comment it stays `failed`.
#
# THE WORKFLOW INPUT CONTRACT (the workflow template declares the same inputs):
#
#   action           run | pause | warm | stop
#   branch           the run's branch; also the dispatch --ref for run, pause
#                    and stop. `warm` sends GitHub's default branch as both
#   engine           task | user_review | docs            (action=run only)
#   resume           none | answer | pause                (action=run only)
#   answers          {"<n>": "<answer_<n>.md bytes>", ...} (resume=answer only)
#   park_loop_clear  true, sent only when --park-loop-clear is given
#   chain            automatic dispatches since the last user action; a
#                    user's dispatch sends 0                (action=run only)
#
# The workflow's `run-name` is `harness <action> <branch>`, and the job-side
# pause poll and `continue` / `poll` match runs by that title, so the spelling
# is a wire: `pause` and `stop` send the branch as their `branch` input for
# exactly that reason.
#
# `stop` DOES FOUR THINGS, IN THIS ORDER. (1) It ALWAYS dispatches action=stop
# on the branch — a jobless run titled `harness stop <branch>` that GitHub keeps
# as the stop marker `continue` and `poll` read. It is first because it is the
# only part that reaches a usage-paused run waiting on the resume poller, which
# has no job to cancel; a marker dispatch that fails exits 3 at once, before any
# cancel. (2) It lists the branch's runs of the workflow and cancels each run
# titled `harness run <branch>` whose status is `queued`, `in_progress` or
# `waiting` — never a jobless `harness stop` / `harness pause` marker, which has
# no job to stop and may complete before its cancel lands — trying every one even
# after a failure. (3) Only when (1) and (2) all succeeded, and only when a
# local registry record exists, it writes `remote_stopped_at` and sets `status`
# to `failed` in one `hr_registry_set` call; a partial stop leaves the record alone
# and exits 3, so running `stop` again is the remedy. (4) A complete stop is then
# reported as `report stopped` with the note `--note <text>` when given, else
# `Stopped by @<actor>.` under `--actor` (a login, the trigger's shape plus an
# optional `[bot]`; anything else is a usage error), else one naming a local
# stop; a partial stop reports nothing. Under `--pr <n>` that report's comment
# and label go to pull request <n> whatever its state — the open-PR lookup
# cannot find a closed one — and the issue is still labelled. The cancelled
# job's own `failed` is then posted nowhere, because `report` finds the branch
# stopped. `--branch-gone` is for a branch GitHub no longer has: (1)'s marker
# is dispatched with `--ref` set to GitHub's own default branch (read as `warm`
# reads it; a failed read exits 3 before anything is sent) and still carries
# `-f branch=<branch>`, so its `harness stop <branch>` title is unchanged;
# (2)'s listing also reads `headSha,createdAt`; (4) reads the issue from the
# task prompt at the newest `harness run <branch>` run's `headSha` through the
# contents API rather than from `origin/<branch>` (a failed read is one line
# and no issue), and its text says the branch was deleted, so the run cannot
# be resumed, and that its workflow runs and artifacts are kept. (4) also
# reports on each pull request of the branch from this repository that is not
# merged and still carries `running`, `parked` or `paused`: each gets the same
# comment, the `stopped` label and its progress comment marked stopped
# (`forge_gone_prs_var`, `forge_progress_stopped`). The issue read
# rests on GitHub serving a commit no branch points at, which is unverified
# (`docs/github-run-control.md` -> `## 8. What is not verified here`).
#
# `warm` dispatches action=warm on GitHub's OWN default branch (`gh repo view
# --json defaultBranchRef`), which may differ from the configured
# `defaultBranch`: a cache saved there is the one every branch can restore.
#
# WHERE gh RUNS. From the main checkout (`hr_main_repo` of the working
# directory) unless `--repo <root>` names another, so gh resolves the
# repository from that checkout's remote. The configuration read is that
# root's `harness.config.json`.
#
# WHAT IT NEVER DOES. It never launches a local session but `control`'s one
# read-only mention session (MENTION, in `control`'s paragraph), never writes the
# inbox, and never watches a run it sent beyond the bounded lookup of its
# listing that `trigger` and `review` make. Only `start` and `review` push, and
# only through `create-worktree.sh` and `push-branch.sh`; `start`'s writes are
# the prompt committed on `origin/<branch>`, through a working copy and a local
# branch it removes before it returns, and, after a push that did not land, a
# fetch that force-writes that copy's `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>`
# (`hr_push_landed`'s, to name the commit the remote moved to); `review`'s are
# the round committed on `origin/<branch>`, through the record's mirror or a
# copy and a local branch it removes, and, after a push that did not land, the
# same `hr_push_landed` fetch force-writing `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` in
# that mirror or copy, the record's `status` / `engine`, the bundle download
# directory `sync` uses, and `report`'s writes for the round. Its settledness
# read, when the newest run's job GitHub never started, also fetches origin's
# <branch>, force-writing `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` in the root checkout:
# for a local `/autonomous-sdlc-harness:branch-user-review`, the main checkout. A user's chain-0 `dispatch --resume answer|pause`
# writes the record's `status`, `resumed_at` and `resume_kind` in one write
# when the main checkout's registry file exists and holds a record with
# `execution: github-actions`; any other `dispatch` writes nothing. `trigger` writes its snapshot and comment
# files under `RUNNER_TEMP`, one comment on the issue and the label removal, or
# for a dispatch event a block in the step summary. `report` writes its comment
# file under `RUNNER_TEMP` (removed), one comment and the state labels on the
# issue and the pull request, and nothing local. `open` writes its body and
# comment files under `RUNNER_TEMP` (removed), at most one pull request, its
# `running` label and one comment on the issue. `deliver` writes its body and
# comment files under `RUNNER_TEMP` (removed), at most one pull request, one
# comment and the state labels. `control` writes its reply file, its `fetch`
# directory and, for a mention, its context directory and the session's output
# files under `RUNNER_TEMP` (removed) and one reply comment, plus
# what the child verb it runs writes, and the fetch of origin's <branch> that
# force-writes `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` in its checkout. `collect` writes its round file and its
# settledness directory under `RUNNER_TEMP` (removed), at most one comment, on
# the pull request, or on the issue for a run whose job never started, and for
# that event `report`'s state labels on both items and one push notification,
# the fetch of origin's <branch> its settledness read makes for such a run,
# force-writing `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>`, plus what its `review` child
# writes. `stop`, `continue` and `poll` also make
# `report`'s writes for each event they report. Every other verb's only writes are the
# registry record (`stop`, `sync`) and, for `sync`, the download directory
# `<state_dir>/autonomous_logs/remote_download/<branch>/<id>/` and
# `<branch>.remote.log` in the main checkout, plus the mirror restore
# `hr_remote_bundle_restore` performs in the record's `worktree`, and, when
# the newest run's job GitHub never started, a fetch force-writing
# `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` in the main checkout; for
# `restore`, that download directory, the job restore (the planning drafts
# among it), `answer_<n>.md` and the
# `park_loop_cycles` rewrite of `remote_status.json`, all in the job's
# checkout; for `save`, <out_dir> and the step summary; for `poll`, its
# download directories and `<state_dir>/autonomous_logs/poll_state/previous/`
# and `current/`. For `fetch`, <out_dir> and, when the newest run's job GitHub
# never started, a fetch force-writing `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` in the
# root checkout. For `discard`, the removal of <dir> only. `pause-requested`,
# `run-created-at` and `list` write nothing, and `status` writes nothing but,
# with no record, that same fetch; a no-record `status` downloads into a
# temporary directory it removes on exit.

# <branch>` run listed), `running` (the newest is not `completed`), `applied`
# (its id is <applied_run_id>: `sync`'s case 1, decided there), or the state
# of `sync`'s cases 2-5, which it derives in that order. A bundle is downloaded
# into <download_dir> — `sync`'s per-run directory under the main checkout when
# empty — skipped when that directory already holds its status.json, and
# RS_BUNDLE is then 1. <applied_run_id>, when set, also counts as a bundle
# existing for case 4. <finished> 1 reads the newest run as finished whatever
# its `status`: `branch_settled_var` passes it once that run's `run` job has
# completed. RS_RUN_CREATED_AT is the newest run's `createdAt` (ISO 8601).
# RS_NOT_STARTED is 1 only in cases 4 and 5, when `run_not_started_var` finds
# GitHub never started that run's RUN_JOB_NAME job; RS_ENGINE is then
# `forge_dispatch_engine_var`'s answer, and case 5 with one is `paused` /
# `killed`. Replaces GH_OUT in cases 4 and 5. Exits 3 when gh fails, 2

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE FORGE SURFACE — the one place this script reads or writes an issue or a
# pull request for a run. Every function sets globals rather than printing,
# never exits, and reports a failure as one `remote-run.sh: …` line on stderr.
#
# THE TARGET RULE. A comment goes to the open same-repository pull request
# whose head is the branch when `forge_recognised` holds for that branch — its
# origin tip carries its task prompt or its flow-progress ledger — else to the
# issue the run was started from (`FORGE_ISSUE`), else nowhere. The task prompt
# counts so that a pull request opened at the run's start is a target before
# the ledger's first push. The state label goes on that issue and on that pull
# request, each when known.
#
# THE LABEL IS A VIEW, NEVER AN AUTHORITY. The run list is the authority
# (`remote_state`); the harness overwrites any state label set by hand, and
# nothing reads one back to decide anything.

# every author `authorise_actor` accepts, the `HARNESS_RUN_ACTORS` allow-list
# included; a refused author's items are dropped with one line, while a
# failed permission call (status 4) fails the collection. What earlier rounds consumed is
# read from the marker lines of their files on origin's tip; with none marked,
# the boundary is the committer time of the newest round file. A comment
# belonging to a pending review is pending whatever its `created_at`: a draft
# comment is created before its review is submitted. RC_EVENT, set by the
# caller, is the event's own review as a JSON object, merged when the listing
# lacks it. Sets RC_REVIEWS (the kept reviews requesting changes only),
# RC_REVIEWERS (distinct logins of every review written, comma-joined, in
# order) and RC_EVENT_ROUND (the round whose marker records RC_EVENT's id).
# Returns 0 with <out_file> written; 1 when no review requesting changes is
# pending, writing nothing and recording nothing, so a *Comment* or *Approve*
# review rides along in the next round one requesting changes starts; 3 a listing or a permission call failed; 4 the
