#!/usr/bin/env bash
# push-branch.sh — push the current non-protected branch to its upstream, and
# never abort the run that called it.
#
# WHAT IT IS FOR. This is the single mechanism every unattended commit point
# calls right after a commit lands, so the remote branch reflects the local
# commit chain no matter where the run stops — the watcher after its task-prompt
# commit, the `committer` agent's opt-in push, and the task, user-review-fix and
# planning orchestrators. It is invoked as a SEPARATE statement from the commit
# (never `if commit-on-branch.sh …; then push-branch.sh; fi`: that compound is
# not covered by the guards and stalls an unattended run), which works because a
# push with nothing new to send is a harmless no-op — so callers may run it
# unconditionally, including after a commit wrapper that made no commit.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER EXISTS AT ALL. Same reason as its sibling: an invocation of a
# script path under the configured scripts directory is allow-listed literally
# by the generated permission profile and auto-allowed by the script-allowlist
# guard (when its basename is not on that guard's deny list, in a command
# carrying none of `$(…)`, a backtick, `|`, `<`, a braced form other than a bare
# `${IDENT}`, or a `>` that is neither a descriptor duplication (`2>&1`, `>&2`,
# `2>&-`) nor a redirection to the literal `/dev/null`), where a `git push`
# command line assembled with a shell expansion is matched statically by
# neither and draws a prompt an unattended run cannot answer.
#
# EVERY FAILURE PATH IS NON-FATAL (exit 0). A non-git directory, a detached
# HEAD, a protected branch, a configuration that cannot be resolved, or a failed
# push (a transient network, say) is made VISIBLE with a one-line message but
# must NEVER abort the calling run — a stale remote is recoverable and a halted
# run is not. That is why this script uses `set -uo pipefail` deliberately
# WITHOUT `set -e`, and why even the fail-closed arm below exits 0: it refuses
# to push, which is the closed outcome here, and says so. A push the remote
# refused for any reason but a `[rejected]` ref is attempted up to
# PUSH_ATTEMPTS times in all — waiting PUSH_RETRY_DELAY_SECS before the second
# attempt and three times that before the third — and is still never fatal once
# given up. PUSH_RETRY_DELAY_SECS is read from the environment as a test and
# tuning seam: default 5, and anything but a non-negative integer falls back to
# 5 with one line.
#
# A BRANCH ITS REMOTE DELETED STAYS DELETED. A branch this checkout tracks on
# its remote is never pushed when that remote no longer lists it. It tracks one
# when `branch.<branch>.merge` is set, or when `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>`
# resolves; a branch with neither is a first push and is not checked. The remote
# asked is `branch.<branch>.remote` (else `origin`), for `branch.<branch>.merge`
# (else `refs/heads/<branch>`), once with `ls-remote --exit-code` before any
# push attempt. Exit 2 (not listed) skips the push with one line naming the hand
# push that publishes it again; any other failure is not evidence of a deletion,
# so the push goes ahead and reports its own result. Reason: Gate 12 round 9,
# finding 1 — a run stopped because its branch was deleted had that branch
# re-created by the job's `always()` push step. Accepted costs: a deletion that
# lands between the `ls-remote` and the push is still pushed back; and a local
# branch reusing the name of one deleted on origin is not pushed while its stale
# `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` survives — the skip line names the hand push.
#
# DEFENCE IN DEPTH, NOT THE SOLE GUARD. The caller-agnostic backstop is the
# committed pre-push hook `init` writes into the configured `githooksDir`, which
# git runs on every push GIT PERFORMS, however it was started. That backstop is
# caller-agnostic WITHIN GIT: a tool that implements push against the git backend
# itself, as `jj git push` does, performs no git push and runs no git hook. The
# plugin's protected-branch guard refuses an agent-submitted push only when it
# can PROVE the target is protected, and is silent on the rest — and it is the
# layer that sees a `jj git push` and refuses one that NAMES a protected target,
# so the two cover different callers. Neither covers an argument-less
# `jj git push`, which runs no git hook and gives that guard nothing to prove;
# only a forge-side ruleset does. This
# script refuses too, so it is safe when called from outside an unattended
# profile — and it takes its protected set from
# `<repo_root>/harness.config.json` at run time through
# `lib/harness-run-lib.sh`, which is where that set is kept in step across all
# of them. There is no second list to keep in sync with: a branch name written
# into this file would enforce the wrong set the moment `protectedBranches`
# changed, and nothing at all in a repository whose integration branch is named
# something else.
#
# WHAT IT NEVER DOES. It performs only a fast-forward push of already-committed
# work: no `--force`, no `--force-with-lease`, no history-rewriting flag, no
# commit of its own, and no non-zero exit, and never pushes back a branch it
# tracks after its remote deleted it. It never retries a push git reports
# as `! [rejected]` (non-fast-forward, fetch first), and never fetches or
# rebases: a push that lost a race fails loudly, which is the run-control rule
# of record (docs/github-run-control.md -> "A push that loses a race fails
# loudly, and is never fetched, rebased or retried").
