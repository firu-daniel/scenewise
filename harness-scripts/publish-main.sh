#!/usr/bin/env bash
# publish-main.sh — regenerate `main` from `dev`: take dev's tree, remove this repository's own
# harness adoption from it, and stage the result on the `publish` branch as ONE ordinary commit,
# for a pull request a human merges onto `main`. Hand-written for this repository, ported from the
# autonomous-sdlc-harness repository's own scripts/publish-main.sh: it is not in the set
# `init --force` regenerates, and it is itself one of the paths it removes, so it never reaches
# `main`.
#
# THE BRANCH MODEL IT SERVES. `dev` is the trunk: it carries the product AND the adoption
# (harness.config.json, .claude/, harness-scripts/, githooks/, sdlc-harness/, the harness-*.yml
# workflows), feature branches are cut
# from it and merge back into it by pull request, and `defaultBranch` in harness.config.json names
# it, so worktrees are cut from it too. `main` carries the product and nothing else, and is never a
# merge target. A merge from dev into a main that deleted those paths would raise a modify/delete
# conflict on every artifact touched since the previous merge; this script builds the tree directly
# instead, so there is no merge base and nothing to conflict.
#
# WHO RUNS IT. .github/workflows/publish-main.yml, on every push to `dev` — so each feature pull
# request merged into dev becomes one commit on main. It can be run by hand with --dry-run to see
# what would be published; a real local run would be refused by githooks/pre-push, which protects
# `publish` alongside main and dev, and that is intended: a publication is staged by CI alone.
# scenewise's own scripts/ holds product gates CI runs and is published like any product file.
#
# WHAT A PUBLICATION IS. A commit whose tree is dev's tree minus the removed paths, whose ONLY
# parent is main's tip, and whose message ends in a `Published-from: <dev sha>` trailer. One parent
# makes it read like a squash merge: dev's granular history is not reachable from main. Author and
# committer are taken from dev's tip commit, so main keeps the identity of whoever merged the pull
# request. If the pruned tree equals main's tree — a push that touched only removed paths — nothing
# is published.
#
# HOW IT REACHES MAIN, AND WHY NOT BY PUSH. `main` is protected by a ruleset that requires a pull
# request and restricts updates to the repository admin role, through a pull request only,
# deliberately: nothing automated may write to it — a bypass actor cannot be scoped to one
# workflow, so granting one would hand every future workflow in this repository a direct write to
# the published branch. This script therefore force-updates the `publish` branch to the publication
# commit and stops. A human opens the pull request and merges it; the commit's parent is already
# main's tip, so that pull request is a fast-forward.
#
# MERGE IT WITH "REBASE AND MERGE". The guard below finds the last publication by walking main's
# FIRST-PARENT line for the `Published-from` trailer. A merge commit would put the publication on
# the second parent and hide the trailer from that walk; a squash rewrites the message and can drop
# it. Either way the next run reads main as carrying an unaccounted commit and refuses to publish.
# `main-protection` pins `allowed_merge_methods` to `rebase` for exactly that reason — the trailer
# stays on the first-parent line, which is the one place the guard reads.
#
# THE MESSAGE. dev's tip is read as the pull request that produced it: GitHub's merge commit
# ("Merge pull request #N from …", PR title in the body) publishes as "<PR title> (#N)"; a squash
# merge's subject is already that shape and is used as is; anything else publishes under its own
# subject. When more than one first-parent commit is being published, the body lists them all.
#
# THE GUARD. A publication replaces main's content with dev's, so a commit that landed on main by
# any other route would be silently undone by the next one. Before publishing, every first-parent
# commit on main since its last publication must be accounted for: either it is already in dev's
# history, or a commit in the unpublished range of dev carries git's `cherry picked from commit
# <sha>` line for it — which is what `git cherry-pick -x` writes. Otherwise the script refuses and
# names the commit. Port it to dev that way and the next push publishes. Before the first
# publication, main has no `Published-from` trailer anywhere, and main's tip must then be an
# ancestor of dev — true for the dev that was branched from it.
#
# THE REMOVED PATHS are root-level and exact (the workflows are named one by one). What the docs
# phase writes under docs/ describes the product and is published. The managed block `init` writes into .gitignore is cut out of that
# file rather than the file removed.
#
# Usage: publish-main.sh [--dry-run]
#   --dry-run  build the publication and print it; push nothing
# Exit: 0 published, or nothing to publish · 1 refused or failed · 2 bad usage
